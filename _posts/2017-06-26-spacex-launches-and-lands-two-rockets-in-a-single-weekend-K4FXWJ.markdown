SpaceX's technical problems that caused an explosion last September seem well behind it, as it pulled off the rare feat of launching two rockets this weekend. On Friday, the Falcon 9 lofted a Bulgarian communications satellite into orbit from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, landing the recycled first stage at sea. On Sunday, it pulled off the trick again, sending ten Iridium-2 satellites into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Once again, it brought the first stage safely back to drone ship "Just Read the Instructions" despite visibly rough weather and rolling seas.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the drone ship had to be repositioned due to "extreme weather" and warned that launch and landing "will be tight" (see the full video, below). Musk pointed out new titanium grid fins used to aerodynamically maneuver the Falcon 9's first stage for the Iridium launch. Clearly visible in the landing video, they're made of "a single piece of cast and cut titanium ... [and] can take reentry heat with no shielding," he tweeted.

In 2007, it rebooted the network as "Iridium Next" with an 81-satellite constellation, 75 of which will be launched by SpaceX. The aim is to "provide services for aviation, maritime, internet of things, terrestrial and government organizations," says SpaceX. The two launches are the closest together yet for SpaceX. The launch of the Bulgarian satellite and recovery of the first stage marked just the second time SpaceX has used (...
