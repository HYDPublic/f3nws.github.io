Elon Musk's latest venture, The Boring Company, has certainly been a source of amusement . Now, the billionaire visionary has tweeted that he's received verbal government approval to build an New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore-DC Hyperloop, which will get you from New York to Washington, DC, in 29 minutes. It currently takes approximately two and a half hours to travel between the two cities on Amtrak's Acela Express. Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2017 The company is currently working on tunnels aimed at relieving congestion in LA . Musk tweeted that the New York-DC Hyperloop would be constructed in parallel ( with city center to city center service , including up to a dozen entry/exit points per city), followed by a Los Angeles-San Francisco loop. He also envisions a Texas (Dallas-Houston-San Antonio-Austin) Hyperloop as a possibility. That's some pretty far-off planning. For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2017 We're not sure who is going to work with Musk and The Boring Company on these projects ( we've asked, but Musk hasn't responded ). Chances are, though, that it will be Hyperloop One. The company recently completed a successful test of its mag-lev transport system , but even more importantly, it's staffed by former SpaceX workers and Musk is friends with its co-founder. We're skeptical that this project will ever happen, but you can't say that Musk doesn't have interesting ideas. Source: Elon Musk
