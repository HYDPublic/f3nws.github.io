Most dads are embarrassing to some extent, but some dads are so impressively embarrassing they come round full circle and become cool. SEE ALSO: Dads having more fun than daughters at Little Mix concert is seriously adorable Burr Martin, who last year achieved viral fame after he began recreating his daughter's selfies, is definitely one of those dads. Well, apparently it was a year ago today that all this started. Little did I know.... And in case anyone thought this whole thing might have been a publicity stunt , notice that I only shared it with friends. I was too Embarrassed to make it public back then.
