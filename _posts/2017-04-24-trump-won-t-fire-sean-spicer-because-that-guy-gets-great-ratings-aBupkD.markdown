Why have a reality show when you can turn reality into a show, am I right? White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is not a man widely known to be good at his job. He tells blatant falsehoods to the press, consistently mispronounces the names of foreign leaders, and recently proved Godwin's Law IRL. His daily press conference always seems like a train that's about two run-on sentences from derailing and wiping out a news cycle. This is not normally considered good, but it is highly watchable for middle-of-the-weekday TV. And to Spicer's boss, anything that watchable must be good.
