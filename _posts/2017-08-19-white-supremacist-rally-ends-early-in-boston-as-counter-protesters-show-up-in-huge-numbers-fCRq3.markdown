A few dozen attendees showed up for Saturday's planned "free speech" rally in Boston. But counter-protesters showed up in the thousands. Per local news reports , over 10,000 people gathered at Boston Commons to protest the right-wing gathering, which quickly fell apart after it became clear the planned speaking schedule would not come to fruition.
