Get ready to facepalm, Intel fans. The company's upcoming Coffee Lake CPUs apparently won't work with existing stocks of motherboards, a manufacturer confirmed on Wednesday. In a Twitter post by Asrock last Saturday, the company flat-out said the new CPU won't work with today's motherboards. When asked by Evan Jensen "...will the Z270 Supercarrier get support for the upcoming @intel Coffee Lake CPU's?" Asrock's official twitter account, @ASRockInfo replied: "No, Coffee Lake CPU is not compatible with 200-series motherboards." According to at least one reliable source outside of Intel, the new Coffee Lake CPU will indeed not be compatible with Z270 boards, even though the chipsets with the upcoming Z370 appear to be the same, PCWorld was told.
