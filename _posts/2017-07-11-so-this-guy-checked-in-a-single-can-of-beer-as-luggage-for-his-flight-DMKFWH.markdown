Here's perhaps a story that'll help you keep the faith in baggage handlers. An Australian man who wishes to be only known as Dean, caught a Qantas flight from Melbourne to Perth on Saturday and claimed he was able to successfully check-in a single can of Emu Export beer as part of his luggage, purely for the fun of it. SEE ALSO: The Beer Can Regatta could surely only happen in Australia "It honestly just seemed like a good laugh, an idea a mate and I cooked â€” pretty much a meme in real life for all the export drinkers out there," Dean explained via Messenger. For those not familiar, Emu Export is a beer originally from Perth. To explain why he was bringing the beer back there, Dean said "he arrived too late to check it in heading out of Perth."
