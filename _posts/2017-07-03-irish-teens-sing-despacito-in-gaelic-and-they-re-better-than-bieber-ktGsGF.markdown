It takes a decent amount of nerve and courage to take on the song of the summer. But, one group of Irish teenagers absolutely crushed their rendition of "Despacito" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee feat. Justin Bieber. Students at Irish language summer school ColÃ¡iste Lurgan in County Galway, Ireland, performed a version of "Despacito" in Gaelic. And they absolutely nailed it.
