It's probably not a good idea to tease things that are perfectly capable of eating you. A man spotted an Asiatic lion in the Gir Forest National Park in India and got a little too wrapped up in watching the king of the jungle. In the clip, released in September of 2016, the man drives just a few feet away from a lion walking alongside the road. He's filming the whole thing, with his window down, no less. After teasing the lion with his car for a bit, the lion stops, stares at the man and lets out the tiniest, yet powerful roar. While the lion's actions were small, it was enough to freak out the man. He quickly rolled up his window and let out a shriek that seems to say, "OMG I'm I almost just died." Read more... More about Lions , Animals , Viral Videos , Watercooler , and Watercooler
