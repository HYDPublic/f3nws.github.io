Yesterday was a big deal for all the fans of James Cameron's Avatar . Pandora – The World of Avatar – located in the Animal Kingdom Park in the Walt Disney World Resort – opened to guests staying at Disney resort hotels at 7am, and then to the general public an hour later. Needless to say, people were eager to get in on the action. The main attractions of the park are the two rides, Avatar Flight of Passage and Na'vi River Journey , and people lined up to get on them early. Like really early. One of the first people to enter the park said he got there at 5 a.m. He told the people cued up on line just to get into Pandora that their patience would pay off. Read more...
