The latest rumor about the iPhone 8 could make audiophiles very happy and one-up its biggest rival — even if it raises the cost of the already potentially super-expensive flagship. The deluxe 10th anniversary model of the iPhone might ship complete with Apple's latest, most-beloved iPhone accessory: AirPods . The current 7 and 7 Plus phones are packaged with basic wired EarPods with a Lightning connector, so having true wireless buds right out of the box would be another major upgrade. The news comes to us via a JP Morgan investors note, obtained by 9to5Mac . The firm recently made us question its validity with bold claims about the iPhone 8 based around sketchy sourcing and guesswork — but this leak appears to have some more beef to back up its claims in the form of some new device schematics. It's unclear when this investor note went out based off 9to5Mac's report. Read more... More about Leak , Rumors , Airpods , Iphone 8 , and Apple
