Amazon already has lockers in various public locations that you can use to receive packages, but it's now offering a more private option for multi-tenant dwellings. The e-commerce titan has launched a new service that offers to install " Hubs " in condos, apartment buildings and complexes for use exclusively by people who live there. Once it's installed, Amazon doesn't care who uses it for delivery -- you can use it to receive parcels from other websites, retailers and even from your relatives. The Hub is meant to solve a common problem for tenants in residential buildings, especially those with no concierge or frequently open management offices. It's always accessible, always open and isn't exclusive to Amazon packages. To access a box, simply type in your passcode on the Hub's touchscreen panel. Based on the service's official website, landlords can customize a Hub for their properties. The locker has an indoor and an outdoor version and is available in four colors and several sizes, starting at 6-foot wide. If you're determined to convince your landlord to get one, point them to the Hub's portal to submit an application. Via: TechCrunch Source: The Hub
