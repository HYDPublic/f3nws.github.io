Australia's marriage equality debate has sparked the attention of celebrities and major companies worldwide, including Ellen DeGeneres , Tim Cook and now, Sir Elton John. Sir Elton is currently in Australia for his "Once in a Lifetime" tour, hitting six shows around the country. Meanwhile, Australians are currently in the midst of a non-binding, non-compulsory nationwide survey asking the question: “Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?” Parliament can make the change now, but before it does, it's taking the country's temperature on the matter.
