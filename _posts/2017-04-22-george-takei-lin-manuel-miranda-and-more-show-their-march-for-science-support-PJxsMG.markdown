As hundreds of Marches for Science took place around the globe , science-loving celebrities sounded off on social media to show their support. A few marched themselves ( looking at you, Peter Capaldi ). Others, unable to make it, sent messages of encouragement and thanks to participants. Bonus: Lin-Manuel Miranda's message involved a dog. Yes, if nothing else, we can take comfort in the fact that many celebrities appear to know that, indeed, there is no Planet B. Whew!
