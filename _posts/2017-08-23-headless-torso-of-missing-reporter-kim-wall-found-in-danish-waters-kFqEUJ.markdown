The headless torso of a woman found at sea was identified Wednesday as a Swedish journalist who likely died aboard a Danish inventor's homemade submarine.

Danish inventor Peter Madsen has been accused of the negligent manslaughter of the 30-year-old reporter who went to interview him aboard his 60-foot (18-metre) submarine on August 10.
