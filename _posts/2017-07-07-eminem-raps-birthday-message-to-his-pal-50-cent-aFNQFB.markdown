Why send someone a birthday card when you can send them a happy birthday rap instead? To mark his friend 50 Cent's birthday, that's exactly what Eminem did. SEE ALSO: You're not going to believe who inspired Eminem's hit album, 'The Eminem Show' "First off I want to say happy birthday," Eminem says in the video above. "Secondly I want to remind you of the verse you did that made me want to quit rapping." He then launches into a cover of 50 Cent' "Places to Go". If all birthday messages were delivered via the medium of rap, the world would surely be a much more fun place. Read more... More about Youtube , Birthday , 50 Cent , Rap , and Eminem
