With the release of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch just around the corner, Target is getting in the Mario Kart spirit with tricked-out shopping carts. There's no way this could go wrong, right? Over 650 Target stores in the U.S. are getting decked out with Mario Kart -inspired shopping carts (also known as Super Target Karts), decorations, and a starting line-like entrance complete with black-and-white checkers, a lakitu, flashing lights, and music. The promotion starts today. Target is basically giving you the green light to take shopping carts and race through the store as quickly as possibly. People will definitely be throwing things at each other. Read more... More about Gaming , Nintendo , Mario Kart , Mario Kart 8 Deluxe , and Shopping Carts
