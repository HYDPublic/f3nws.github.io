Apple's 10 year run of festival organizing is over. For now, at least. Apple confirmed on Monday with Music Business Worldwide that the annual Apple Music Festival had been cancelled for the foreseeable future. Held annually at London's Roundhouse, the Apple Music Festival (formerly iTunes Festival) started in 2007, and has billed the likes of Amy Winehouse, Paul McCartney, Katy Perry, Adele, Arctic Monkeys, Coldplay, One Direction, Lady Gaga and more over the past 10 years.

Last year's lineup indicated the festival was in a pretty damn good place, with Elton John, Chance the Rapper, Alicia Keys, Britney Spears (with that backflip ), Calvin Harris, The 1975, and more on the bill.
