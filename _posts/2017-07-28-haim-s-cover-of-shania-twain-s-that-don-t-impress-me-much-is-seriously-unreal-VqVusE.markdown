The '90s song you probably won't admit you like — but secretly really, really do — got a cover from HAIM, and it's out of this world. Shania Twain's "That Don't Impress Me Much" was covered on Australian radio station triple j , but instead of extending the rambunctiousness of the 1997 hit, the three piece went for a stripped back version that is really, seriously, quite unexpected. HAIM also covered Twain's "Man! I Feel Like a Woman" last month, so look, it's probably not going to be the last cover of the Canadian country singer we'll hear from the band. Can we get "From This Moment On" next? Read more... More about Music , Australia , Culture , Band , and Haim
