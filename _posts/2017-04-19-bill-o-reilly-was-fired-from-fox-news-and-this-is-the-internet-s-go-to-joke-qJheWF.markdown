Someone else will be sitting behind his desk when Bill O'Reilly, the long-time host of Fox News' prime-time cash cow The O'Reilly Factor , returns from "vacation" next week. On Wednesday, 21st Century Fox announced that the longtime conservative talk show host would not return to the network after advertisers dropped the show in droves following multiple allegations of sexual harassment against him. Naturally, that caused everyone online to make the same joke and probably made O'Reilly wish he could go back in time and name the show something else.
