Editor's note: This article was updated to reflect AMD's official pricing for Radeon Vega Frontier Edition at launch, as early preorder prices were much more expensive. We've also included details from PCWorld's Vega Frontier Edition hands-on preview. After months of trickles and teases, the full hardware details about the first Radeon Vega graphics card are finally here as AMD formally launched Radeon Vega Frontier Edition on Tuesday. Don’t get too excited though. This hardware is intended for “data scientists, immersion engineers, and product designers” rather than gamers. That professional focus reflects in the pricing: The air-cooled Frontier Edition costs $1,000 and the liquid-cooled Vega goes for a cool $1,500 on Newegg. (That's cheaper than initially expected, however, as online retailers like SabrePC, Newegg, and Exxact originally listed earlier preorders at $1,200 and $1,800, respectively.)
