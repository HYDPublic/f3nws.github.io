The Handmaid's Tale continues to be an awards magnet for Hulu. The show won the coveted "Outstanding Drama Series" Emmy Award tonight -- a first for any streaming offering -- following five other major triumphs throughout the ceremony. And that's on top of snapping up three Creative Arts Emmys during a smaller celebration last week. The Handmaid's Tale is Hulu's biggest series yet, and its success shows the value a streaming network can get from producing their own programming.

Tonight, British import Black Mirror won two awards for the incredible San Junipero episode: "Outstanding TV Movie" and "Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie or Special." The latter is a notable win for the show's creator, Charlie Brooker, who initially caught some flack for bringing the series to Netflix. Finally, Aziz Ansari and Lena Waith picked up the "Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series" award for Master of None. Noticeably absent from the stage this year? Amazon. Its Emmy mainstay Mozart in the Jungle won a Creative Arts Emmy, along with the short form series Dropping the Soap . But Amazo...
