A man in Canada covered his head in bees for just over an hour in downtown Toronto Wednesday, as you do, to promote the release of a new movie. Juan Carlos Noguez Ortiz from nearby Dickey Bee Honey Farm grew what's known by practitioners of the bizarre ritual as a "bee beard" for the stunt, which saw him engulfed in insects for 61 excruciating minutes. He smashed the previous record of 53 minutes, 34 seconds, according to local media who were watching the horror at the city's Yonge-Dundas Square.
