This recap contains spoilers for Outlander Season 3, episode 2, titled "Surrender." If the Outlander Season 3 premiere focused on the isolation that Claire and Jamie felt following their separation, episode 2 reminds us of the connections that keep them tethered to their new lives â€” albeit reluctantly, in Jamie's case. After returning to Lallybroch in the final minutes of episode 301, we find Jamie eking out a solitary existence in a cave somewhere in the woods on the estate, hiding out from the English soldiers who continue to patrol the area and who seem to spend an inordinate amount of time harassing Jenny and Ian for their suspected Jacobite sympathies. Jamie returns periodically to deliver game he's caught and check in on his sister, and he's often visited by Fergus, but he's clearly no longer the warrior he once was, refusing to teach his young protege how to shoot to try and protect him from the wrath of the English.
