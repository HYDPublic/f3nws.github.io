Ahead of the original Apple Watch launch, Tim Cook during an earnings conference call said that Apple would not be disclosing Apple Watch sales figures. The ostensible reasoning at the time was that Apple didn't want competitors to see its sales data. While that line of reasoning may have arguably seemed plausible a few years back, the landscape today is a lot different. The Apple Watch has been around for two and a half years and is a mature product at this point. And still, Apple remains reluctant to provide us with concrete sales figures for the Apple Watch, save for some abstract statements about increasing sales. During Apple's most recent earnings conference call, for example, Tim Cook boasted that Apple Watch sales were up 50% year over year. That's an impressive figure, to be sure, but it still seems somewhat bizarre that Apple refuses to divulge specific sales figures, especially if Apple Watch sales continue to trend upwards. With Apple keeping quiet, the only way to ascertain how many Apple Watch units Apple has sold to date is to rely upon guesstimates from analysts.

So while we've seen Apple Watch sales estimates before, it's always worth paying attention when Dediu throws his hat in the ring.

My estimate has been that Apple sold about 15 million Watches in the last 12 months at an average price of about $330. This puts the Apple Watch revenue run rate at $4.9 billion, indeed above Rolex. They may be slightly high but the news makes me feel quite comfortable in my methodology. Note also that within the last quarter Apple said sales for the Watch increased by 50%. This is also refl...
