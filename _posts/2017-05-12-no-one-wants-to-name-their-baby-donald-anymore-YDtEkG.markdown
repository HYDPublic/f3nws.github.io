For some reason â€” and we really can't think why â€” no one wants to name their babies Donald anymore. According to 2016 data from the U.S. Social Security Administration released Friday, the name "Donald" hit a new low and decreased in popularity quite dramatically. Our president's first name was ranked at just 443 in 2015 but last year it dropped 45 spots to an even more pathetic 488. SEE ALSO: Dear Star Wars fans naming your sons Kylo: Why? Anyone else catch that 45-point drop? Any connection to Trump being the 45th president? Anyway, The Donald and Donald Jr. can be somewhat reassured that the biggest decrease went to the male name "Jonael" with a 475-point drop. But still, the value of our president's first name has dropped. He can't say he has the best name. Read more... More about Caitlyn Jenner , Donald Trump , Baby Names , and Watercooler
