July 1 was a big day in Nevada. At midnight, dispensaries could legally start selling marijuana for recreational use. Nevada voters chose to legalize recreational marijuana back in November, and that decision went into effect on Saturday. People over 21 years old can buy weed with ID at the state's dispensaries. Buying from anyone not licensed by the state and smoking weed in public are still illegal. Legal weed in Nevada means legal weed in Las Vegas, and many of the Nevada residents most excited for midnight to hit lined up in Vegas last night. Many people lined up overnight as Las Vegas began selling legal pot for recreational use for the first time. https://t.co/T1wmvf1fvh pic.twitter.com/BnugOk41P1 â€” CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) July 1, 2017 Read more...
