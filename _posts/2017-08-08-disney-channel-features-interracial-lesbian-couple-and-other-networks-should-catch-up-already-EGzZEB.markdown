The Disney Channel continued to show its commitment to diversity and inclusivity last week with an episode of Doc McStuffins titled "The Emergency Plan," which also featured an interracial lesbian couple as parents. Voiced by Wanda Sykes and Portia de Rossi (two IRL lesbians), the most important aspect of the representation was the fact that the show didn't really call any attention to the same-sex couple at all. Instead, the show taught kids how to prepare for an earthquake, while also presenting parents who happen to be lesbians.
