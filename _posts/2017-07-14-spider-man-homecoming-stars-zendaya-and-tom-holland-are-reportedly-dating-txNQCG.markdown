Spider-Man: Homecoming stars Zendaya and Tom Holland are apparently dating, reports People . In the film, Zendaya, 20, plays the friend of 21-year-old Tom Holland's Peter Parker, but the two allegedly became more than friends behind the scenes. An anonymous source tells People “they started seeing each other while they were filming Spider-Man. They’ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye but they’ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.” Zendaya and Holland both tweeted about the claims, but neither denied it.
