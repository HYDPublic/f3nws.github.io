Tin Star , a new drama coming to Amazon Prime Video , just got a premiere date and a trailer. The show stars Tim Roth who plays ex-British detective Jim Worth who recently moved his family to a small Canadian town called Little Big Bear. But a big oil refinery moves into town shortly thereafter, bringing with it lots of problems including organized crime, and the company's corporate liaison -- played by Christina Hendricks -- seems to be the strong, unwavering front of an even stronger, unsavory corporation. However, Wright is no saint himself and after a family tragedy, his violent, alcoholic alter-ego Jack is awakened. The show is written by 28 Weeks Later writer Rowan Joffé and features Genevieve O'Reilly of Rogue One and Episodes , Christopher Heyerdahl of True Blood and Kevin Hanchard of Orphan Black . The show premieres September 29th on Amazon and you can check out the trailer below. Source: ComingSoon.net
