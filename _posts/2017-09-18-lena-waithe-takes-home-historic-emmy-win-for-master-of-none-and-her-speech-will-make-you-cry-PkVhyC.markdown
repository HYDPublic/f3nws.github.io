Master of None "Thanksgiving" was more than just one of the best television episodes of 2017.

In her speech, Waithe spoke directly to her LGBTQ+ family, saying "I see you, I see all of you" and urging love, acceptance and support (Ansari, who won last year, stood aside and let her do the talking).
