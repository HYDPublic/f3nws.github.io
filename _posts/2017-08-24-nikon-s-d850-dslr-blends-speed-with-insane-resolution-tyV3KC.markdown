Nikon recently teased a full-frame D850 for its 100th anniversary, hoping it would fulfill the wish-lists of pro photographers. It has now unwrapped the DSLR and seems to have wildly succeeded with that goal. The D850 is entering medium-format territory, resolution-wise, with a 45.7 megapixel sensor, and can push those images through the camera at 7 fps, or 9 fps with the optional battery grip. And this time, Nikon didn't leave videographers out, as it can handle 4K video at 30 fps. The D850's sensor is a pretty big jump in resolution over its predecessor, the 36.2-megpixel D810, and Nikon says it has an "unprecedented combination of resolution, dynamic range, ISO and processing power." It's the company's first DSLR to boast a back-side illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor, and eschews optical low-pass filter (OLPF) to preserve maximum sharpness. Nikon didn't mention who built it, but Sony uses a pretty similar sensor on its 42-megapixel, full-frame Alpha A7R II. ISO ranges from 64 to 25,600, but is expandable from 32-102,400. It borrows the D5's rapid-fire 153-point, multi-cam 20K autofocus, with 99 cross type sensors. Thanks to a new Expeed 5 image processor, you can buffer up to 51 frames of 45.7-megapixel 14-bit RAW imges, or 170 frames at 12-bits, making the higher frame rates more useful. The D850 also has a "silent shooter" mode, so you can operate in "complete silence" using Live View and the electronic shutter -- handy for shooting sensitive events. Video-wise, you're looking at 4K UltraHD (3,840 x 2,160) resolution that uses the full width of the sensor at 16:9, "to increase lensing options and provide a true field of view," Nikon says. You can also capture 1080p video at up to 120 fps. Timelapse freaks get 8K images using the built in intervalometer, or 4K in-camera. UltraHD video can be captured to the D850's memory cards (XQD or SDHC II). However, higher-quality 4:2:2 8-bit uncompressed video (no 10-bit, sorry) is only available via the HDMI output to an external recorder -- which is very similar to how Sony's A7R II works, by the way. Videographers a...
