Fifty years ago, a clever, determined woman named Kathrine Switzer crossed the finish line at the Boston Marathon â€” but not before an official tried to drag her from the course. See, at the time, only men competed in the race. Switzer signed her registration as "K.V. Switzer," was accepted and, despite efforts to remove her from the 26.2 mile competition, became the first woman to finish it as an official entrant. Her bib number, 261, remains famous.
