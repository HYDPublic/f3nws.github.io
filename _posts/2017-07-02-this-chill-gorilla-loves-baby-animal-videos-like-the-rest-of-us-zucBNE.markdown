When the news cycle stresses you out , there's perhaps no better escape than glimpsing upon an adorable animal friend. Take, for instance, this gorilla at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky. He's serene, calm, and content. He looks like a great listener. And he, like us, really enjoys watching videos of baby animals. My new friend and I enjoy watching videos of baby gorillas! 😍😍😍🦍 #mylifeiscomplete #hereallylovedthisyall A post shared by Lindsey Costello (@lindseyncostello) on Jun 29, 2017 at 7:51pm PDT Lindsey Costello visited the zoo's gorilla enclosure on June 30.
