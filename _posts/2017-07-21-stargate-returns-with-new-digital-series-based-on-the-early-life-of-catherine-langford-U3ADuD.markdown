It's been 6 years since we said goodbye to Stargate Universe , but now a new iteration of the beloved sci-fi franchise is making its way to our screens. MGM announced at Comic-Con that the studio will be launching a 10-episode premium digital series, Stargate Origins , which will follow fan-favorite character Catherine Langford â€” whose father first discovered the Stargate in 1928. Catherine was played by Viveca Lindfors in the original movie and several different actresses in Stargate SG-1 . The live-action show will debut on a dedicated new digital platform, Stargate Command, which will also host a comprehensive collection of Stargate content from across the franchise's 23-year history.
