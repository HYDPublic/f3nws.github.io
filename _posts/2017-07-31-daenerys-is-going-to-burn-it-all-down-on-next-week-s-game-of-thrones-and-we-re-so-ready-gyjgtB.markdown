Daenerys hasn't had the best luck in conquering Westeros so far — she's already lost all of her ships and her three most powerful political alliances, and we're only three episodes into Season 7. But as we see in the promo for episode 4, "The Spoils of War," it's obvious that Dany's done with "clever plans" — instead, it looks like she's going to take a leaf out of Cersei's playbook and burn this mother down. As Tyrion pointed out this week, it's pretty risky for her to venture out with all of her dragons and no backup (wouldn't it be handy if she found two other secret Targaryen dragon-riders to help her out?) — but maybe what Khaleesi needs is a little outside-the-box thinking to turn the tide against Cersei, who's now so confident in her position, she's not even trying to hide the fact that she's banging her brother from the servants anymore.
