The Essential Phone, coming from the workshop of Android creator Andy Rubin, is finally out after months of teasing . And it's probably the most exciting smartphone launch in years. The phone is a looker: Titanium on the back, an enormous screen on the front, extending all the way to the top and broken only by the phone's selfie camera. The screen actually wraps around the camera, which could be a horrible idea but for now we can only say that it looks cool. SEE ALSO: Android O: Everything you need to know It comes with a set of top-notch specs: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 2560 x 1312 pixel resolution (that's a 19:10 ratio, so different from both the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8), 4GB of RAM, a 13-megapixel dual rear camera coupled with an 8-megapixel selfie cam, a fingerprint sensor on the back, 128GB of storage, a 3,040mAh battery.
