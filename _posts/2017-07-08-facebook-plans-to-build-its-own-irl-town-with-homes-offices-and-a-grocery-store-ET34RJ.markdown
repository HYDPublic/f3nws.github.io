Facebook isn't content with just governing everything you do online. The social networking giant announced plans this week to turn part of its Menlo Park, California property into a "mixed-use village" that'll be like its own town. The property at Facebook's corporate headquarters will contain a grocery store, a pharmacy, housing, office space, and other services that people usually access in their own, non-Zuckerberg-controlled towns. "Part of our vision is to create a neighborhood center that provides long-needed community services," said a post on the Facebook Community page. Facebook intends to file its plan with Menlo Park this month. The company expects the review process to last two years, and for construction to follow in phases. The first set of stores, housing, and office space could be completed in 2021. Read more... More about Tech , Facebook , San Francisco Bay Area , Housing Crisis , and Housing Affordability
