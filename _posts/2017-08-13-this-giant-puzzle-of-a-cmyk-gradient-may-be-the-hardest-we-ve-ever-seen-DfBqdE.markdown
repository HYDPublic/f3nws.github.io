For some, jigsaw puzzles are a slow, relaxing pastime that exercise the creative and logic centers of the mind. For others, it's their version of a personal hell. If you’re one of the former, it’s time you experienced Clemens Habicht’s 1,000 Colours . This is no ordinary jigsaw puzzle — because of the subtle changes in color, it’s a true test of patience, process, and attention to detail that’s not for the faint of heart (or the faint of sight). 1,000 Colours is one giant CMYK gradient split into 1,000 pieces with — you guessed it — a shade for each tile.

Instead, you’ll need to consider how each color flows into the next, and rely on trial and error to find the perfect fit for each piece. Because of this, veteran puzzlers may find 1,000 Colours to be one of the most meditative puzzles they've ever completed. Read more...
