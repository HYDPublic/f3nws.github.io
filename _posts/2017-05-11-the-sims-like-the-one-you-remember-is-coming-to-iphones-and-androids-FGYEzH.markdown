It's the moment we've all been waiting for. Gaming company EA has announced that The Sims will soon be coming to iPhone and Android devices. SEE ALSO: "The Sims" Creator Developing TV Show with User-Generated Episodes And we don't mean The Sims like the previous ones that we got, that were really different from the original game we all loved growing up. (I'm looking at you, The Sims FreePlay , and The Sims Social .) This one is said to be truest to the one that was released 17 years ago. Needless to say, people are pretty psyched. Hey @TheSims give me The Sims Mobile NOW!! It looks so amazing!! I cant believe it has multiplayer!! I'm so excited! 🎉🎉🎉 — AviatorGaming (@AviatorGaming) May 9, 2017 Read more...
