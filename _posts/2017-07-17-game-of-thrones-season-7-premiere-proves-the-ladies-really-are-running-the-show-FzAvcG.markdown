This recap contains spoilers for Game of Thrones Season 7, episode 1, titled "Dragonstone." Who run the world? The ladies of Game of Thrones , duh. After multiple seasons of mansplaining, rape and abuse , the women of Westeros are finally in positions of power in the Season 7 premiere, and it's every bit as exhilarating as watching Wonder Woman stride through No Man's Land with bullets bouncing off her gauntlets. The first new episode in over a year opens with Arya Stark doubling down on her spectacular murder of Walder Frey last season by killing all of his remaining bannermen and supporters â€” and she does it in the most deliciously devious way possible, by impersonating the old traitor himself. The mic drop moment comes when Arya tells Walder's poor, long-suffering wife, "When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers; tell them winter came for House Frey." If you didn't cheer, you may be a wight. Read more... More about Game Of Thrones , Sansa Stark , Arya Stark , Daenerys Targaryen , and Game Of Thrones Season 7
