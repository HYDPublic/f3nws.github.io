Technically, Todd Beaty and the rest of the team at Cruz Bay Landing should have left St. John more than a week ago. Nonessential occupants were asked to get off the island ahead of Hurricane Irma, a Category 5 storm that obliterated much of St. John, the smallest of the three U.S. Virgin Islands. That storm raged over the island earlier this month, but Beaty and his restaurant staff remain open, and they plan to stay open even as Hurricane Maria swirls toward the island.

The storm is projected to track south of St. Thomas and St. John, which might spare the island from Category 4 or 5 intensity winds. Maria is more likely to make landfall on the island of St. Croix, but it'll probably still harass St. Thomas and St. John with powerful winds and buckets of rain. Read more...
