Originally reported by Business Insider , the impetus behind the technology is to help store staff "respond more efficiently to customer service issues before shoppers have a chance to complain." Interestingly enough, this isn't the first time Walmart has toyed around with facial recognition technology. Just a few years back, a number of Walmart stores over a period of a few months installed facial recognition cameras in the hopes of identifying suspected or known shoplifters as they entered the store. At the time, Walmart's little experiment generated a fair amount of criticism from people who raised a variety of privacy concerns. Undoubtedly, Walmart's effort to roll out technology designed to monitor the emotions of its shoppers in real time will also usher in a debate about privacy. Walmart's patent on the technology reads in part: "It is easier to retain existing customers than acquire new ones through advertising. Often, if customer service is inadequate, this fact will not appear in data available to management until many customers have been lost.
