Tonight, during Valve's " The International " Dota 2 esports tournament the company announced it's making a spinoff card game associated with its popular MOBA. Other than its name, Artifact , a brief teaser trailer and a release window of 2018, we didn't get any details, but Dota fans have been dreaming up Hearthstone -like card game iterations for years, so it should be well-received by the community when it drops. Former Double Fine developer Brad Muir ( Iron Brigade , Massive Chalice ) revealed he's been working on the project "for a while now" but that's all we know. I've been working on @PlayArtifact at Valve for a while now! Can't wait for you guys to play it! :D! — Brad Muir (@MrMooEar) August 9, 2017 Artifact is the new #Dota card game from Valve. Check out our teaser we just revealed during The International. #TI7 https://t.co/ODoct5vkZL — Artifact (@PlayArtifact) August 9, 2017 Source: PlayArtifact (YouTube)
