Spoiler warning: This recap contains plot details for Outlander Season 3, episode 1, titled "The Battle Joined." Try as Jamie Fraser might, he just can't seem to die. He enters the Battle of Culloden devastated by the reality of having to say goodbye to his wife and unborn child, but also assured of their safety, having sent them (and the rest of his Lallybroch men) out of harm's way before the battle begins. That leaves his way clear to die a heroic (if unnecessary) death among his countrymen, knowing the defeat that awaits them thanks to Charles Stuart's hubris. But even after one final, bloody, surreal showdown with Black Jack Randall, death refuses to come for our noble hero. Read more...
