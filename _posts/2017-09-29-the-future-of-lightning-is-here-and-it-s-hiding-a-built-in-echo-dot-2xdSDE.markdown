This awesome futuristic lamp has adjustable color temperature, touch controls, and mood settings, and it can even be controlled from your smartphone. Automations and scenes are also supported, but the cherry on top is the built-in Alexa controls.

Here’s what you need to know from the product page: * AMAZON ALEXA BUILT IN: Featuring the functionality of a standalone Alexa device, C by GE Sol with Amazon Alexa is wifi connected and allows you to use your voice to control lighting features, set timers, check the weather, tell time, and play music from your Alexa enabled music library * EXCLUSIVE FEATURES: More than a smart light, Sol features visual cues for clocks and timers, manual and automated light temperature variation that allows users to select the perfect hue to fit a mood or to ensure a smooth sleep cycle * SMART LAMP FOR ANY ROOM: A perfect lighting solution for the office, the bedroom, the kitchen or living room.
