It's really hot in San Francisco right now. Like, really, really hot. Temperatures in the Bay Area reached 106 degrees Farenheit on Friday. That's 106 degrees in foggy, chilly northern California, where late-summer temperatures are usually in the high 60s. The 106-degree day broke a record for all-time hottest temperature in San Francisco in recorded history, or at least 143 years. A second consecutive day of extreme heat forecast for Saturday across the #BayArea and Central Coast.
