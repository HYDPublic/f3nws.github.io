When the total solar eclipse hits on Aug. 21, it's going to be quite the party . The problem? Solar panels need the sun to generate electricity. With the sun dimmed, solar energy sources will be affected. More than 100 million solar panels are expected to be affected, which will drop output by 20 percent â€” or the equivalent of all the energy the city of San Francisco uses in a week.

In Germany, which leads the world in solar power usage, output dropped from 14 gigawatts (GW) to 7 gigawatts, according to Gizmodo . Here in the states, utility-scale solar production is about 21.25 GW . It helps that the eclipse won't totally black out the sun over California and other states where the most solar energy is generated, so it won't disrupt the power grid. But it'll still mess things up. Read more... More about Science , Solar Energy , Energy , Nest , and Eclipse
