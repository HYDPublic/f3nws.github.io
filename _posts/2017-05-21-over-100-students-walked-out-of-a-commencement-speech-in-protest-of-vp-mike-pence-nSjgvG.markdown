Vice President Mike Pence 's commencement address to the University of Notre Dame Class of 2017 didn't go as smoothly as he probably would have liked it to, thanks to protesters who walked out as the vice president began his remarks. The protest, which was organized by the University of Notre Dame student activist coalition We StaND For , saw over 100 students walking out of the commencement ceremony on Sunday afternoon to a few boos and a few cheers.
