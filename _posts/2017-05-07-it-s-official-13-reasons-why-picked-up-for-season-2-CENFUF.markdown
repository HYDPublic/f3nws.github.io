Netflix has renewed 13 Reasons Why for Season 2 , just over a month after the buzzy teen drama premiered online. Mashable has confirmed that the show will return for 13 more episodes in 2018, and Brian Yorkey will continue to serve as showrunner. Season 2 "picks up in the aftermath of Hannah Baker's death and the start of the characters' complicated journeys toward healing and recovery," per Netflix's logline. Fans suspected that the drama was heading for a Season 2 pickup after it emerged that 13 Reasons star Ross Butler would be unavailable to film Season 2 of Riverdale (in which he'd appeared as a recurring character during Season 1) because of a prior commitment to another project that Butler couldn't discuss at the time.
