To be fair, it's got to be difficult to move around in and see out of that Mario suit. The Mario actor that hopped and skipped around Nintendo's stage in Japan — the one we saw being constructed outside of the upcoming Universal Studios theme park, Super Nintendo World , earlier this week — actually does a fairly decent job twirling and keeping his/her balance while in the clunkiest clogs I've ever seen. But, as per usual, video game designer and father-of-Mario Shigeru Miyamoto steals the show, looking absolutely, adorably comfortable in his Mario hat.
