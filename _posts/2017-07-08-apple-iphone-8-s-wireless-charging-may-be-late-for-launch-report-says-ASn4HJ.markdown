No, the Apple iPhone rumors are not done. You will take your iPhone rumor medicine, and like it. Actually, you might not like this one. SEE ALSO: This isn't the iPhone 8. But it's probably really, really close. In a late night Twitter message on Friday, John Gruber, an Apple-focused writer and podcaster who occasionally comes up with early info on the company's products, delivered some new details around rumors of the iPhone offering wireless (inductive) charging. "I've heard that inductive charging will (a) be sold separately, and (b) might be late, waiting for iOS 11.1 (a la Portrait mode last year)," wrote Gruber. "I'm not sure if the holdup is hardware or software. And they could catch up in next three weeks." Read more... More about Apple , Iphone , Rumors , Iphone 8 , and Tech
