After six summers of researching, testing, and recommending window air conditioners, we've learned that quiet and affordable ACs make most people the happiestâ€”and we think the LG LW8016ER will fit the bill in most rooms. It cools as efficiently and effectively as any model with an equal Btu rating, and runs at a lower volume and deeper pitch than others at this price. Little extra features like a fresh-air vent, two-axis fan blades, and a removable drain plug help set it apart, too. How we picked and tested The air conditioners we tested in 2017.

Installation and maintenance should be easy, but they don't vary too much from model to model, and you have to deal with them only a couple times per year. And cooling power and energy efficiency are so similar for window ACs at a given Btu rating that it's barely worth worrying about. For this guide, we focused on models with 8,000 Btu, which are the most popular size and are suited for spaces between 300 and 350 square feet. Our testing began by tracking down about 45 current-model window air conditioners with that cooling capacity. Based on specs, features, price, and our experience with older versions of some models, we settled on eight finalists.
