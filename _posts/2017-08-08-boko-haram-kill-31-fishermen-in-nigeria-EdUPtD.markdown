At least 31 fishermen have been killed by Boko Haram jihadists in two separate attacks on islands in Lake Chad in northeastern Nigeria, fishermen and vigilantes fighting the Islamists told AFP late Monday. Armed jihadists stormed the fishing islands of Duguri and Dabar Wanzam in the freshwater lake Saturday, attacking fishermen working in the area and shooting and hacking their victims. "Boko Haram attacked Duguri and Dabar Wanzam islands and killed 31 people," a member of a local militia fighting the jihadists in Maiduguri, Babakura Kolo told AFP.
