If you've seen Dunkirk , it is quite simply not quite like any war movie you've seen before. The film made a big impact on 97-year-old veteran Ken Sturdy, who watched the film in Calgary and is one of the few people in the world who is still alive and was in Dunkirk, France, during World War II. "I thought I would never see that again. It was just like I was there again," he told Global News. Sturdy was a signalman with the Royal Navy, helping soldiers reach boats ready to evacuate them from the beach. "I was 20 when that happened, but I could see my old friends again and a lot of them died later in the war," he added. "I went on convoys after that in the North Atlantic. I had lost so many of my buddies." Read more... More about Film , Movies , Canada , Culture , and Veteran
