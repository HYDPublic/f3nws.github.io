Hey y'all, spoilers for Season 7, episode one below. If you haven't watched it, don't get upset with us if you read it. Um, I don't know if you've ever heard of a character named Daenerys Targaryen, but she's home now. The last big scene in "Dragonstone" finds that unlikely Targaryen sailing her ships across the Narrow Sea as her three adolescent dragons fly above. And then, you guessed it, she lands on Westeros. She's there. She's home. As much of the internet yelled at their screens this Sunday night, "The queen is home."
