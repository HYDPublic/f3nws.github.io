John Boyega has become the latest actor to criticise Game of Thrones for its lack of diversity. The Star Wars star made the comments in a recent interview with GQ , in which he spoke about the wider issues of race representation in the film and TV industries. "There are no black people on Game of Thrones ," Boyega said. "You don't see one black person in Lord of the Rings ."

Last year Selma actor David Oyelowo criticised the show's treatment of actors of colour , and the diversity issue has previously been addressed by George R.R. Martin himself on his LiveJournal.
