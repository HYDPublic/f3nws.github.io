London celebrated Queen Elizabeth II's 91st birthday with Trooping the Colour , her annual birthday parade, on Saturday. The Queen's great-grandson, however, was not impressed. Three-year-old Prince George watched the parade from a balcony (and behind a window) at Buckingham Palace with his family. Looks like a boring parade. Image: David Hartley/REX/Shutterstock Same.
