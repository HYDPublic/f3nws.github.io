One of the largest icebergs ever recorded — measuring about the size of Delaware and containing a volume of ice twice the size of Lake Erie — has broken free from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in northwest Antarctica, according to scientists monitoring the region. The iceberg weighs about a trillion tons, according to a team of researchers affiliated with a UK-based research project, known as Project MIDAS. While the iceberg calving event itself is likely mostly natural, it nevertheless threatens to speed up the already quickening pace of ice melt in the region due in large part to global warming. (Calving is when chunks of ice break off at the terminus, or end, of a glacier or ice shelf, such as Larsen C.) Read more... More about Climate , Nasa , Science , Global Warming , and Antarctica
