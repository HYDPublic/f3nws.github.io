Hey cool kids, this post has spoilers for Season 7, episode one. So, like, don't read unless you've watched. Duh. You know when you're watching your favorite high fantasy television show and then this mega famous pop star just shows up in a scene and rips you out of the episode? That was the feeling of many Game of Thrones fans when Ed Sheeran, of all people, sat in the woods singing a supposedly-Westeros-y song as Arya Stark rode by on her horse. And of course she dismounted, and of course there was a little bonding scene between her and the English pop star.
