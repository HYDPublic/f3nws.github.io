Ahead of Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone X event tomorrow, Tim Cook sat down for an interesting interview with Adam Lashinsky of Fortune . Though the interview doesn't provide us with anything nearly as tantalizing as the iPhone X leaks we saw over the weekend, it does give us even more insight into Tim Cook's views on a varied number of topics, including the environment, human rights, and the misplaced narrative that the iPhone is becoming far too expensive. When asked about Apple's affinity for healthy margins and high-priced products, Cook, interestingly enough, fought back a little bit. Well it’s not high margin. I wouldn’t use that word.

We obviously wouldn’t have over a billion products that are in our active installed base if we were making them for the rich because that’s a sizable number no matter who’s looking at the numbers. It's a reasonable point, to be fair. While some might scoff at the notion that Apple doesn't create products for the rich, the reality is that Apple in recent years has done a better job of making i...
