The spacecraft, known as GOES-16, is still in an experimental phase, but the data it provides is available to National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters already. As meteorologists test out the capabilities of this new platform, which launched last year, they are revealing new insights on storm systems. With Harvey, the satellite's lightning mapper — which tracks lightning over land and out to sea, where current observations fall short — revealed something fascinating. Read more...
