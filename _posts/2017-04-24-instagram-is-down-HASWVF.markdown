Instagram is down for some users. The outage affects both the web and mobile versions of Instagram. Currently the largest usage areas — North America, Europe, Asia, South America, and the Middle East — all seem to be affected by the outage, although we’re not sure yet what the problem is. We’ve reached out for comment, and will update this piece as needed. For now, just hop on Twitter and explain your lunch in 140 characters.
