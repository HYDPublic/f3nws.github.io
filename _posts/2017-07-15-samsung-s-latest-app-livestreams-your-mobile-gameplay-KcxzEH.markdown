You can even use your mic to chat with friends if you want, and save up to 4GB or 200 minutes of gameplay -- whichever comes first -- in a throwback to Game Recorder+ . Compared to its music app and email attempt , on the surface at least, this seems like a piece of Samsung software you'd actually want to use. Via: AndroidPolice Source: SamMobile
