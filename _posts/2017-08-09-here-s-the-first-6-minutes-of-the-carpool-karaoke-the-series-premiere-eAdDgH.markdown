James Corden's mega-popular segment now has an Apple flavor. You can catch the first six minutes of the premiere episode of Carpool Karaoke: The Series , which released on Tuesday night, as part of a 16-episode season for Apple Music. Will Smith is the first guest, and they open with a rendition of "Gettin' Jiggy Wit It." Then they get into a very over-the-top version of "Boom! Shake The Room," while also discussing if Smith would ever play Barack Obama. There's also a teaser of other hosts and guests, such Gwyneth Paltrow (an easy choice, given she's in another of Apple's shows, Planet of the Apps ), Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner from Game of Thrones, and Billy Eichner singing it out with Metallica, of all people.
