With that success, Alphabet X has quietly been working on Glass Enterprise Edition with a design that's more comfortable and can withstand the rigors of work environments. It's also got a bigger display prism, foldable design and speedier Atom processor. "We've ... made improvements to the design and hardware so that it's lightweight and comfortable for long term wear. We've increased the power and battery life too," Alphabet X's Jay Kothari writes. Glass has thus morphed from a trendy accessory worn by Diane von Furstenberg and Sergey Brin at a fashion show, to a more practical factory, medical and warehouse device sported by managers, doctors and blue collar workers. Google also brought a raft of developers onboard to build apps that take advantage of Glass's main advantages: the fact that it's hands-free, lightweight and unobtrusive. DHL, for instance, ...
