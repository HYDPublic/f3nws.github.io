For a man who owns a boatload of hotels, you'd think President Donald Trump would have no problem finding a comfortable room to crash. According to reports from local media, Trump had a little trouble finding a hotel room in Hamburg, Germany for his stay during the G20 summit this week. The Hamburger Abendblatt reports that Trump was initially trying to stay at the Four Seasons, but it was apparently already filled up by Saudi Arabia’s King Salman's huge crew.
