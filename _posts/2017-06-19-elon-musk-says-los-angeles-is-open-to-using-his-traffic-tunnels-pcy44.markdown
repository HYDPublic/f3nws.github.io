Elon Musk might just have the first customer for his traffic-skipping tunnels . The tech entrepreneur says he's having "promising conversations" with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti about using The Boring Company's technology as part of a larger underground network that would shuttle cars, bikes and people. It's not clear exactly how well the talks are going, but Garcetti is clearly open to the idea -- he even name dropped Musk's effort during an ABC interview . As Musk observes, though, the technology is the easy part... it's the legal clearance that's hard. The Boring Company will need extensive permits if it's going to create a whole grid of high-speed tunnel transports underneath LA, and it'll be no mean feat to convince officials that such an ambitious project should go ahead. Still, this is a start. And when LA is both highly dependent on cars and infamous for its traffic, the city might be receptive to some audacious ideas. Promising conversations with @MayorOfLA regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes & pedestrians. Permits harder than technology. https://t.co/0dxrXBOOWy — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 18, 2017 There could be an #express train @unionstationla to @flyLAXairport --Here's @MayorOfLA @ericgarcetti on #Newsmakers . #WATCH 11AM Sun @ABC7 pic.twitter.com/zJAFTge2VO — Adrienne Alpert (@abc7adrienne) June 17, 2017 Source: Elon Musk (Twitter) , Adrienne Alpert (Twitter)
