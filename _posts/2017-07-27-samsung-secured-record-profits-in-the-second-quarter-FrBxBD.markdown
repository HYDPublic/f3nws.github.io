As expected, Samsung registered a record operating profit of 14.07 trillion won ($12.6 billion US) in Q2 2017. Interestingly, the breakdown reveals that while its mobile division's (including Galaxy S8 / S8+ ) sales were up over the same period last year , profits dropped slightly, which Samsung attributed to higher component costs. Luckily, since Samsung also makes chips for phones, storage and more, that division drove the record profit and seems poised to continue. Looking forward, Samsung confirmed a new Galaxy Note is coming soon "with enhanced performance and features, to maintain the strong sales momentum of its premium smartphones, together with the Galaxy S8 and S8+." Meanwhile, it also says "continued growth is expected thanks to stable supply of 10nm mobile processors and increased supply of OLED DDIs for flagship smartphones." Those OLED displays likely include not only its devices but also the rumored OLED iPhone 8 , which will reportedly arrive with displays made by Samsung . Source: Samsung
