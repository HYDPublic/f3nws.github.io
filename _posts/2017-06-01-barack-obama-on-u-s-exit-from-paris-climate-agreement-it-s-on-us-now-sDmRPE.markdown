Former U.S. President Barack Obama has a message for everyoneâ€”it's on us now. Obama broke his recent silence on Thursday at almost the exact time Donald Trump announced the U.S. will leave the Paris Climate Agreement. In a statement, he called on local governments at the state and city levels to stay with the deal. "I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack," Obama said in a written statement. "But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations to reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got."
