This week we have too many premieres and finales to mention them all as the fall TV season gets into full swing, but we will highlight the return of Curb Your Enthusiasm on HBO, and the series premiere of Marvel's Inhumans (despite its tepid reviews so far, superhero fans may be better off streaming the latest Spider-Man flick).
