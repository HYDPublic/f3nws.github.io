Australian authorities will make it much harder to keep up with the latest on Game of Thrones . They're expected to crack down hard on dozens of pirate websites that serve unauthorized movies and TV shows within the next couple of weeks. That's because federal courts down under have handed down rulings for two separate cases, both ordering major telcoms and internet service providers (ISPs) to block a total of 59 websites and 127 domains.

Graham Burke, Village Roadshow's co-CEO and the head honcho of anti-piracy group Creative Content Australia (previously known as the IP Awareness Foundation), said : "This is a historic moment for Australia to have what is effectively 95% of the criminal trade blocked.
