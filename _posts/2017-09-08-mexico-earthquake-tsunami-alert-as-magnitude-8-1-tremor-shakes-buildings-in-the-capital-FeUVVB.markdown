Magnitude 8.1 earthquake hits off Mexico Tsunami warnings issued Frightened Mexico City residents gather in streets Blackouts in capital Damage reported in Chiapas state A very powerful earthquake has struck off the coast of Mexico, shaking buildings in the capital and sparking tsunami warnings. The USGS said a magnitude 8.1 quake struck 123 km (76 miles) southwest of the town of Pijijiapan, at a depth of 33 km (21 miles). Widespread, hazardous tsunami waves were possible, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said.

Civil protection officials were checking for damage in Chiapas, but the quake was so powerful that frightened residents in Mexico City more than 650 miles away fled apartment buildings, often in their pajamas, and gathered in groups in the street.
