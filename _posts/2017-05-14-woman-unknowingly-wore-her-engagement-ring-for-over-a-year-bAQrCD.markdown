An Australian woman named Anna unknowingly wore her engagement ring around her neck for over a year, thanks to her boyfriend Terry's crafty plan. Terry explains on YouTube that he made Anna a necklace for their one year anniversary. Anna wore the necklace every day, but little did she know that there was something very special hidden inside the necklace.

Terry asked Anna to borrow her necklace so that he could take a nice photo of it inside the cave, and set up a camera on a tripod with a timer. Read more...
