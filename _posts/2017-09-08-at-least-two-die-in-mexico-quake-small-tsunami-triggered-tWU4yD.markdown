An earthquake of magnitude 8.1 struck off the southern coast of Mexico late on Thursday, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said, killing at least two people, triggering small tsunami waves and damaging some buildings. The quake was apparently stronger than a devastating 1985 tremor that flattened swathes of Mexico City and killed thousands, but initial reports of damage in the city were limited. Three people were killed in the state, said Manuel Velasquez, the governor of Chiapas.
