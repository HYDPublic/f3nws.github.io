Merriam-Webster defines its new word, "sheeple," as those who are "easily influenced." I'm sure plenty of groups of people qualify as said "sheeple."

SEE ALSO: Wake up, sheeple: Your favorite political insult is now officially a word Here's their example : Are you an iPhone owner with a battery case worth about $100? Then you, my friend, have made it to the dictionary. Perhaps it's not the greatest accomplishment, but please take solace in knowing we are all sheeple in our own ways. Read more...
