Facebook's successor to its Internet.org "web for all" service, Free Basics, has had a troubled rollout. India notoriously shut it out of the country back in February 2016 for violating net neutrality (prioritizing Facebook services), with Egypt blocking it months later over privacy concerns. Still, the social titan has deployed Free Basics' free internet to 63 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America -- and wants to bring it to the United States soon. But a report released today criticizes the service's shortcomings and claims its decision to allow access to some sites but not others violates net neutrality. Citizen media nonprofit Global Voices summarized their 36-page paper with several key complaints. First, Free Basics does not adequately meet the linguistic needs where it operates, especially in its failure to operate in more than one language in multilingual countries like Pakistan and the Philippines.

It's this prioritized access to some services, and continually pressuring users to sign up for Facebook's app, that leads Global Voices to claim Free Basics violates net neutrality. The platform separates third party services into two tiers: Those that meet particular technical requirements that are difficult for low-resource organizations to fulfill (as well as route their traffic through Facebook's servers) which are prominently presented, and those that don't which are tucked away. Further, Free Basics pointedly doesn't include email -- or even Twitter -- limited user ability to communicate online. Plus, Facebook is harvesting user behavior data the whole time. This isn't surprising criticism, given India's resistance to these very practices -- not just from Free Basics, but from every "zero-rating" service, as t...
