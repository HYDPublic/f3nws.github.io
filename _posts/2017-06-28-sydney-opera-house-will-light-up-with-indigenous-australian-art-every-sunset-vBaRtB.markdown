The sails of the Sydney Opera House are often a canvas for projections throughout the year, but now the icon is set to be a display for Indigenous Australian art every sunset. It's called Badu Gili, meaning "water light" in the language of the traditional owners of the land the building sits on, the Gadigal people. SEE ALSO: Australia's Uluru is so sacred it's tricky to photograph. This is how Google brought it to Street View. The projection will comprise of a seven-minute animation exploring ancient stories, and will begin its appearance on the sails from Wednesday evening at sunset. Image: DANIEL BOUD Read more...
