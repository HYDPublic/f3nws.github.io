Well, well, well... look who's human after all. Justin Trudeau accidentally forgot to mention Alberta while passionately listing Canada's states and provinces during his Canada Day speech Saturday. SEE ALSO: Ring in Canada Day with Trudeau's best moments (and forget about Trump for a while) The gaffe did not go unnoticed. We're only counting 12 in this list... is there something we should know, Alberta? (just kidding, it was a slip) #Canada150 pic.twitter.com/uuPp1p4uOF — CBC Politics (@CBCPolitics) July 1, 2017 Of course, Trudeau is nothing if not polite, so after broadcast host Sandra Oh pointed out the error, he trotted back out to say "I love you, Alberta!" He also tweeted an apology — a uniquely Canadian thing to do on Canada Day. Got too excited somewhere over the Rockies. Sorry Alberta, I love you. Happy Canada Day! — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) July 1, 2017 Interestingly, Canada's two new astronauts — introduced at Saturday's festivities — are both from Alberta. Will they still get to go into space?! WATCH: Pete Souza's perfectly timed Insta-shade only keeps getting better and better
