This recap contains spoilers for Outlander Season 3, episode 3, "All Debts Paid." Episode 3 of Outlander Season 3 is a pretty big deal for fans of Diana Gabaldon's novels: Not only does it reintroduce a pivotal character in Lord John William Grey (all grown up and decidedly more dashing than the last time we saw him in Season 2), but also closes the chapter on Claire and Frank's tumultuous relationship in surprisingly poignant fashion. While the show has to omit or streamline countless plot points from the novels in the adaptation process â€” including cutting Jamie's trip to seals' isle (although perhaps we'll see it later in flashback) and the many prickly layers of his complicated relationship with Lord John, for the most part, Outlander's writers do an admirable job of staying faithful to the emotional arcs that drive Gabaldon's novels. That's especially true of episode 3, written by Matthew B. Roberts, which takes our heroes on a believable and equally effective journey, even if the signposts are a little different along the way.
