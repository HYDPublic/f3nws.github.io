Lebanon's army on Sunday announced a pause in its offensive against Islamic State group militants along the border with Syria to allow for negotiations on troops taken hostage in 2014. The armed forces launched their campaign against IS militants entrenched in the mountainous Jurud Ras Baalbek and Jurud al-Qaa areas on Lebanon's eastern border on August 19. Nine troops are believed to still be held by IS after militants overran the Lebanese border town of Arsal in August 2014 and kidnapped 30 soldiers and police.
