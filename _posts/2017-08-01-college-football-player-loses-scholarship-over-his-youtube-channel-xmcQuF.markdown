YouTube views can translate into serious dollars , but if you're a student athlete, you may want to think twice about trying to earn money on the platform. A football player for the University of Central Florida has lost his place in the team, and hence his scholarship, due to his YouTube channel.

Despite initially showing his dismay on Twitter and YouTube, he criticized the NCAA and advised his followers to "always stand up for what [they] believe in." He also told Sports Illustrated last month that he feels "like it's about time for things to be changed," since the associated created its rules before the time of social media and video platform...
