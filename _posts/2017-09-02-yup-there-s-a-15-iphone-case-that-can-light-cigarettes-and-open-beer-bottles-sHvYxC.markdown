The ZVE Multifunctional Lighter Case for the iPhone is a gadget that should most definitely be filed under "so crazy that I have to have one." This case looks fairly normal from afar, and it provides solid protection as well. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that this isn’t your average iPhone case. A flameless cigarette lighter can be found on the back, and it can light 540 cigarettes before needing to be recharged. Then, for good measure, there’s a hidden bottle opener that pops out whenever you need it. Here are the highlights from the product page: NO FLAME LIGHTER: ZVE rechargeable electric lighter requires no flame, no gas, no fluid and no butane. It is safe, windproof, environmental and energy-saving. BOTTLE OPENER: A bottle opener is HIDDEN in the top of the case. Which is sturdy enough to open bottles or beers. LONG-LIFE LIGHTER: Lighter can ignite up to 540 cigarettes after about 1.6 hours full recharge with your Apple Lightning Cable. SAFE LOCK DESIGN: The cigarette lighter can be locked if no need to use it. Push the cigarette lighter button THREE TIMES quickly and continuously to lock the lighter case. The same step to unlock it. ZVE 18-MONTH WARRANTY: It suits for iPhone 7 Plus ( 5.5 Inch ). ZVE 18-Month Warranty: Kindly note that only buy from ZVE to get genuine ZVE brand products with quality warranty.
