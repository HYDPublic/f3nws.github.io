The cult of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 is currently in full swing. There's the gleefully cheesy Netflix revival , which came off the back of a successful Kickstarter from the show's creator Joel Hodgson. And, Twitch recently aired a six-day long MST3K binge-fest for b-movie devotees. While streaming services have stepped in to continue its legacy, those seeking physical copies of the show are in for a hard time. Distributor Shout! Factory's plans to release more DVDs of the series just hit a speed bump. In a post on the show's Facebook page, it claims that MST3K Volume 39 will "likely" be the last collection of unreleased episodes of the show. The latest box-set contains four discs in total, which include The Amazing Transparent Man , Girls Town , and Diabolik (no doubt all as abysmal as you'd expect). As a concession, the fourth disc -- known as "Satellite Dishes" -- will contain the host segments from 12 never-before-released episodes. According to Shout! Factory, these remaining instalments may never get a legitimate release due to licensing issues. Here's the full list of episodes (which sound as campy as ever): Ep #201 Rocketship X-M Ep #212 Godzilla Vs. Megalon Ep #213 Godzilla Vs. The Sea Monster Ep #309 The Amazing Colossal Man Ep #311 It Conquered the World Ep #416 Fire Maidens from Outer Space Ep #418 The Eye Creatures Ep #807 Terror from the Year 5000 Ep #809 I Was A Teenage Werewolf Ep #905 The Deadly Bees Ep #906 The Space Children Ep #913 Quest of the Delta Knights Source: MST3K (Facebook)
