A couple of days ago Microsoft enabled a feature that lets Android users easily use the share button to push a web page from their cell phone to a Windows 10 PC. Now, it's released an app to manage the same feature on iOS-powered devices. It's available to users in the "Fast" ring of its Insiders preview program, who will need the latest build released for their PCs. Cross-device web browsing is one of the many features coming in the Fall Creators Update , and every new feature being beta tested means its release date keeps creeping closer. Hey #WindowsInsiders 'Continue on PC' for iPhone is now available! Send web browsing sessions from iPhone to PC! https://t.co/5oI90KfBKj â€” Vishnu Nath (@VishnuNath) July 28, 2017 Source: iTunes , Windows Experience Blog
