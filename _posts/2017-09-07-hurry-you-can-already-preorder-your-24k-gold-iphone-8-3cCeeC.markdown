Who needs a gold- coloured iPhone when you can get an actual gold one? London-based store Goldgenie is all set for iPhone 8 orders already, ahead of the Apple's hotly-anticipated event next week. The company, which also operates in Dubai, is promising to deliver iPhone 8 devices plated in 24K gold, rose gold, and platinum, not to mention — if you like — with diamond-encrusted accents.

Oh, and if plating isn't good enough for you, Goldgenie can also take the phone apart and replace its casing with a solid 18K gold version.
