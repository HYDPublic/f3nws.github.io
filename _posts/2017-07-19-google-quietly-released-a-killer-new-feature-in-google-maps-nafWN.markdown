Google added a neat feature for cyclists in Google Maps in 2014. Whenever you asked for directions from point A to point B, Maps would also provide a little map with an estimated elevation for each part of the route. Now the same is true for walking directions. For each set of directions, you'll get a little interactive map that shows you elevation changes and the overall climb and descent of the route. SEE ALSO: New Google Maps feature helps you avoid traffic hell We're not sure how long the feature has been live (we've asked Google to clarify), but we definitely haven't seen it before. It worked for several people at Mashable in several regions, so we assume it's live for everyone. Read more... More about Google , Google Maps , Tech , and Big Tech Companies
