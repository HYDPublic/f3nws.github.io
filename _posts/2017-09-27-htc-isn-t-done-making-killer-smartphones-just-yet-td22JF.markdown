HTC just sold a huge chunk of its mobile arm to Google, the team that’s responsible for last year’s Pixel phones and the upcoming Pixel 2 model. However, that doesn’t mean HTC has given up on making HTC-branded smartphones, and a new flagship is just around the corner. This phone is apparently an iPhone X and Galaxy Note 8 rival and appears to be even more exciting than the Pixel 2 that HTC Is making for Google. It’s also the kind of Pixel 2 XL phone HTC could have built. The HTC U11 Plus is, as the name suggests, a variation of the HTC U11 flagship phone that was launched a few months ago. It’s a bigger version of the phone, that’s what the Plus moniker denotes. But it’s also an all-screen phone that HTC has never made. And French-language site FrAndroid has more details on it.

But this year, Apple will have two similarly sized iPhones sporting 2013 and 2017 designs — that’s the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Moving on to the HTC U11 Plus, you should know the phone is expected to pack a 5.99-inch LCD display with 2880 x 1440 resolution and 18:9 aspect ratio. That means the phone will compete directly against the iPhone X, Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8, LG G6, and any other all-screen smartphone coming out this year. Other specs include a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage, 12-megapixel single-lens camera, and 8-megapixel selfie camera. The phone is IP68 certified and features an Edge Sense squeezable frame and USB Type-C support. The phone should be unveiled in China on November 11th, more than a month after the Pixel 2 launches, and a few days after the iPhone X hits stores and should cost around €759 in Europe. In other words, don’t be surprised if you won’t rememb...
