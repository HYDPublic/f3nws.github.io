Netflix canceled Sense8 after two seasons, the streaming service announced Thursday. It was a bitter blow to fans of the diverse show, especially on the first day of LGBT Pride Month.

The most gender, sexuality, race, religion, mental health inclusive show quite possibly ever, and you bloody cancel it. Why @netflix #Sense8 — katieroo (@allouratoms) June 1, 2017 Read more...
