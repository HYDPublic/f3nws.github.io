A good granddaughter has to do what she has to do, even if that means breaking a hospital's 'no pets' rule. SEE ALSO: Carry your kitty in this adorable kangaroo pouch hoodie A 21-year-old veterinarian technician's grandma was laid up in a hospital and really wanted to see her dog, despite the facility's reluctance to let puppers roam the halls. And so, the diligent granddaughter, Twitter's HennickShelby, determined that the best way to sneak a cute doggo into her grandmother's hospital room is to disguise it as a baby. And so that's just what she did. She wrapped the canine up like a sleeping babe, put it on her shoulder, and snuck it right into her grateful grandma. That was the first super smart thing she did. The second super smart thing she did was share the feat on Twitter so that we could all see. My grandma is in the hospital right now and wanted to see her dog. So I made it look like I was carrying a baby and we made it ❤ pic.twitter.com/oKxNBlJEEL — Shelbae (@HennickShelby) June 11, 2017 Kudos to this dog, who clearly kept its cool on the elevator ride up.
