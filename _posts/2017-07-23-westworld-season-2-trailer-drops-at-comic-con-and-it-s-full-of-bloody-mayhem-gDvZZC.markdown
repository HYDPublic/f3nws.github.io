Westworld doesn't return to our screens until 2018, but the show has been filming for about a week, according to showrunner Jonathan Nolan â€” which is apparently just enough time to throw together a delicious new trailer for the HBO hit. We open on the show's blood-splattered player piano, and there's plenty of the red stuff on display in the teaser, which sees Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) and Teddy (James Marsden) on horseback, triumphantly hunting down the humans who have spent years toying with them for fun. We also see Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) regarding a dead tiger (It's pretty incongruous to have one of those in the Old West setting of Sweetwater, right? Unless it escaped from a different environment ?) before later hitching a ride with Head of Security Ashley Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth) and some dudes in heavy-duty body armor. Read more...
