The long-gestating Deadwood movie is one step closer to our screens, according to HBO programming president Casey Bloys. Bloys confirmed that he has finally read a finished script from show creator David Milch. "The one thing that I was concerned about was that I wanted a script that would stand on its own; that if you were a Deadwood fan it would make you happy, and if you had never watched Deadwood you could still enjoy it," Bloys said during HBO's presentation at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Wednesday. "I’m happy to say David totally delivered on that — it’s a fantastic script." Read more... More about Hbo , Ian Mcshane , Timothy Olyphant , Deadwood , and Entertainment
