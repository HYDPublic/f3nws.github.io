A new Game of Thrones Season 7 trailer has arrived just in time to celebrate Summer Solstice, because forget what the calendar says, winter is here . (Or it will be in a little under a month, at least.) The White Walkers were conspicuously absent in the first Season 7 trailer , but the new footage more than makes up for it, showing the Night King and his undead army in all their frosty glory. The chilling new trailer release is part of a massive HBO social media campaign to take over the Summer Solstice by "winterizing" the web â€” Game of Thrones fans can unlock exclusive Season 7 content on Twitter, Reddit and Google search, so there'll be no doubt that despite the warm weather, winter is truly here on July 16, and no one is safe.
