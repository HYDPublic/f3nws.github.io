This is Boomer. No, not Michael Phelps' adorable baby Boomer , but Boomer, the Bengali cat who skateboards. Yes, this cat skateboards. And skateboards really well. Boomer's probably better at skateboarding than most people. He's also most definitely more talented than most cats, whose skills mostly consist of eating, sleeping, and playing games on iPad. Just look at how cool and collected Boomer is while he skates through a semi-crowded street. Observe his kicking technique, leaving one front leg on the board and kicking with his others, to keep the acceleration. It's like he's the Tony Hawk of cats. Read more...
