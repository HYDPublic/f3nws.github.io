Who cares about the royal family? Well, this toddler certainly doesn't. She found herself sitting next to none other than Prince Harry at the Invictus Games Toronto 2017, and she seized the opportunity to cosy up to him. SEE ALSO: Everything is garbage but at least Prince Harry and Meghan Markle held hands in public She didn't feel the need to engage the royal in polite conversation. Nor did she fancy shaking his hand. No, this little girl had her eyes on the prize—his popcorn.
