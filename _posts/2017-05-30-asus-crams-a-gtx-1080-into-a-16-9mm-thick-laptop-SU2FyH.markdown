For most people, Zephyrus is the Greek god of the west wind, gently bringing spring, and fruit, to the peoples of the world. For gamers, you can be damn sure that definition is going to be quickly supplanted by the one created by ASUS' Republic of Gamers today. Now, Zephyrus means a pretty damn powerful gaming laptop in a surprisingly slender body, measuring in at just 16.9mm thick when closed, making it the "world's slimmest." By way of comparison, Razer's latest Blade Pro , a high water mark for such laptops, stands at 22.5mm. It appears that ASUS has been one of the principal beneficiaries of NVIDIA's Max-Q design program to shrink high performance gaming laptops. The initiative was announced earlier today, with NVIDIA promising to help laptop makers build devices with powerful internals like the GTX 1080 without the heft. NVIDIA's promise is that the first generation of Max-Q laptops will be three times as fast as their immediate predecessors. Of course, another one of NVIDIA's pledges was to make devices three times as thin as existing devices. Part of that thinness is down to a new thermal design that, when the laptop is open, pushes out a small exhaust port on the underside. That, ASUS promises, will ensure that your lap won't get fried when you use this away from your tabletop. Thankfully, it doesn't compromise the device's looks too much, and it's sturdy, sleek and generally menacing in a way that you'd want such a machine to look and feel. Rounding out the spec list, the Zephyrus will ship with Intel's seventh-generation Core i7 7700HQ CPU and up to 24GB RAM. It's also packing a 4-cell, 50Wh battery, although the company has been reticent to talk about how long it'll live away from a wall socket. Here's a hint: not long. Display-wise, you'll be staring into a 15.6-inch full-HD panel with an anti-glare coating and NVIDIA G-Sync. And if you're on your way to an eSports tournament, you should know that the device will weigh 2.2kg in your bag with the battery. Since Zephyrus ships with the Windows 10 Creators Update, it will take advantage of both Win...
