Hear that, Tesla? Volvo is on board. The Chinese-owned, Swedish car maker has announced Wednesday that "every Volvo it launches from 2019 will have an electric motor." SEE ALSO: Self-driving cars can handle anything, except kangaroos This doesn't necessarily mean all Volvo cars will be purely electric by then. The lineup will be a combo of "mild hybrids," plug-in hybrids and fully electric cars. Volvo already has a few hybrids in its lineup, but it hasn't yet launched a fully electric vehicle. That car, announced in March 2017 , will also come in 2019. But now Volvo has expanded those plans to launch five fully electric cars between 2019 and 2021. Three of those will be Volvos, and two will be "high performance electrified cars" from Volvo's performance brand Polestar. No details about any of those cars were given. Read more...
