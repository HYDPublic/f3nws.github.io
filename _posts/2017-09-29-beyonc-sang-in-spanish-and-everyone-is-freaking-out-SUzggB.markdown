There's no stopping BeyoncÃ©. On Thursday night, a remix of J Balvin and Willy William's "Mi Gente" dropped â€” featuring some ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Spanish verses from Queen Bey. Not only that, she's donating all proceeds from the song to hurricane relief. I am donating my proceeds from this song to hurricane relief charities for Puerto Rico, Mexico and the other affected Caribbean islands. To help go to Beyonce.com/reliefefforts.
