Over the weekend, a Google employee's internally-shared 10-page document attacking a supposed "echo chamber" around diversity and inclusion went viral . Now, Bloomberg reports -- based on an email from the employee himself -- that the author of the memo has been fired. Recode has published a note sent to employees by CEO Sundar Pichai, which maintains that while "People must feel free to express dissent," "To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.

It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects "each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination." The memo has clearly impacted our co-workers, some of whom are hurting and feel judged base...
