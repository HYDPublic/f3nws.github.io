A starving, struggling otter in Arizona was nursed back to health after utility workers plucked it from a canal on the outskirts of Phoenix. The 4-week-old animal was dehydrated and covered with fleas when three heroes from Salt River Project noticed the otter struggling to escape the drying canal. "He was calling for his momma, we assumed," Craig Boggs, one of the utility workers, told the local Arizona news channel KPNX-TV.
