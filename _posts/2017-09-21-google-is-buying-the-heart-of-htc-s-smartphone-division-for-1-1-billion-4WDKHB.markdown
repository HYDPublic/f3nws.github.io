Google and HTC have announced a $1.1 billion cooperation agreement between the two companies, which will send a large part of HTC's smartphone engineering team to Google, in addition to granting the internet giant a license to use HTC's patent portfolio.

Currently, Google designs the device and all the software that runs on it, but specific production engineering issues are handled HTC, as is manufacturing. As a result of this agreement, Google will own the entire process from start to finish. Presumably, Google thinks that's the edge it's missing in trying to make a device that can take down the iPhone. Apple is the only other serious player with total control over software and hardware, meaning we might finally have a fair fight between Android and iOS. “HTC has been a longtime partner of Google and has created some of the most beautiful, premium devices on the market,” said Rick Osterloh, Senior Vice President of Hardware at Google. “We're excited and can't wait to welcome members of the HTC team who ...
