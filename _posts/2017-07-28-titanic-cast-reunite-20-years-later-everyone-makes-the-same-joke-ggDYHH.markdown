If you're wondering why a bunch of Titanic stories have been popping up lately, it's because 2017 is the film's 20-year anniversary. James Cameron is making a documentary about it and everything. SEE ALSO: Titanic 2 could be yours by winning this auction for a Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet dinner On Wednesday, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation held its yearly gala to raise money for environmental causes. A whole bunch of celebrities went, Madonna performed, and — most importantly — Leo's Titanic co-stars made an appearance. So thrilled to reunite with friends and contribute to such an important cause. My painting behind us was auctioned for €100,000.00 last night! @leonardodicapriofdn art auction. Crazy proud! @katewinsletofficial @leonardodicaprio A post shared by Billy Zane (@billyzane) on Jul 27, 2017 at 11:38am PDT Read more...
