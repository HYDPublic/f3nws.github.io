Hey, Megyn Kelly. Here's an idea: maybe don't ask Jane Fonda about her plastic surgery when she's talking about a movie she worked on. In an excruciating interview on the Today show, Fonda and Robert Redford chatted to Kelly about upcoming film Our Souls at Night. Kelly began by talking to Redford about his Hollywood career highlights and his iconic role as Hubble in The Way We Were . But, when she turned to Fonda, Kelly decided to ask her about her appearance, and—specifically—the plastic surgery she's had. Faced with this question, Fonda's face said it all. "You've been an example to everyone in how to age beautifully, and with strength. You've admit you've had work done, which I think is to your credit," said Kelly. Kelly then asked Fonda why she doesn't feel proud to admit that she's had work done. Read more... More about Jane Fonda , Megyn Kelly , Robert Redford , Today Show , and Plastic Surgery
