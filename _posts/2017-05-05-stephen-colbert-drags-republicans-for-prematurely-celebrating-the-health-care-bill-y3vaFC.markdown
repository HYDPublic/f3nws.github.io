White male Republicans were jubilant after the House narrowly passed a new version of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care act. But Stephen Colbert is here to ruin their party. In his Late Show monologue, the TV host reminded everyone that those celebrations are kind of premature. “They did it! Obamacare is finally, officially dead!"…is something they can say once the bill goes to the Senate then gets out of committee, is debated on the floor where amendments can be added, then the Senate votes on their bill, which is sent to the conference committee where the differences between the two bills are ironed out, then voted on in the House and Senate again, the sent to the White House for the president to sign.” Read more...
