Magnitude 8.2 earthquake hits off Mexico Tsunami waves of 3.3 feet measured ​ At least 15 dead, including two children Frightened Mexico City residents gather in streets Blackouts in capital A rare and powerful 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck southern Mexico late Thursday, killing at least 15 people as seismologists warned of a tsunami of more than 10 feet.
