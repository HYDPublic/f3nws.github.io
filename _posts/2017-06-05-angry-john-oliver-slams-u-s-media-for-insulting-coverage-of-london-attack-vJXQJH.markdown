As a British person living in America, John Oliver had a few things to say after the terror attack in London on Saturday night. During Sunday's Last Week Tonight , the comedian took aim at reports on CNN, Fox News, and The New York Times saying that Britain was "reeling" after the attack. “OK, here’s the thing: For the record, in no way is Britain ‘under siege,’” he said. “Is it upset? Yes. Is it pissed off? Oh, you fucking bet it’s pissed off. But to say it’s ‘under siege’ and that its people are ‘reeling’ is to imply that it’s somehow weak enough to be brought to its knees by three monumental assholes. And that, as an idea, is insulting.” Read more... More about John Oliver , London Attack , and Entertainment
