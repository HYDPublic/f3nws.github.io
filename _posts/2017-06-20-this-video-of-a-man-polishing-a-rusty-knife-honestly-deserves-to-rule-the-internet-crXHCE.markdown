The #1 video on YouTube right now is "Polishing a Rusty Knife," uploaded by Japanese YouTuber Jun on Monday. I'll cut right to it — this is a great video, and it deserves this honor. First of all, the narrative arc here is extremely satisfying. As Jun explains, he purchased the rusty knife for $3 — far more than it was worth in its dilapidated condition. So, to get the best of the dude who ripped him off, he painstakingly buffs and sharpens it to perfection. It's a beautiful revenge story! Wow. But the wonders don't stop there. After Jun finishes polishing the knife, he demonstrates its newfound powers by finely chopping a bunch of vegetables — and he's clearly an expert in the kitchen. Now we have two satisfying videos in one! Wow. Read more... More about Videos , Lifestyle , Cats , Culture , and Web Culture
