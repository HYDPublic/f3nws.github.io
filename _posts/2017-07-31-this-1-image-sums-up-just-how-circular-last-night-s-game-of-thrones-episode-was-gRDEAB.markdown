Warning: Contains spoilers for Game of Thrones Season 7, Episode 3. Game of Thrones may seem a touch heavy-handed at times, but in other ways it's incredibly subtle.

Nothing all too subtle about that right? SEE ALSO: Daenerys told Jon Snow she's the 'last Targaryen' and 'Game of Thrones' fans couldn't hide their disbelief Well, not explicitly. But episode director Mark Mylod clearly went the extra mile when it came to the finer details. Read more...
