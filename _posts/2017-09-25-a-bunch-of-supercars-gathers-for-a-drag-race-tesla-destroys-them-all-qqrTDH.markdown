No matter how hard the gas guzzlers try, they still cannot win against a Tesla in a quarter mile drag race. Need proof? Check out the latest edition of Motor Trend's World's Greatest Drag Race, which pitted a Tesla Model S P100D vs. some of the fastest cars available today, including a Porsche 911 Turbo S and a Ferrari 488 GTB. SEE ALSO: A Tesla Model X raced a Lamborghini Aventador, guess which car won The Tesla pretty much crushes everyone in the race with a 10.5 second time. The only worthy competitors were the two cars mentioned above, both with a time of 10.6 seconds. Of course, had the race track been just a little longer, these two beasts (and possibly the McLaren 570GT) would've overtaken the Tesla, which has a top speed limit of 155mph. But this was a quarter mile race, and here, Tesla is pretty much the king. Read more... More about Cars , Tesla , Porsche , Tesla Model S , and Ferrari
