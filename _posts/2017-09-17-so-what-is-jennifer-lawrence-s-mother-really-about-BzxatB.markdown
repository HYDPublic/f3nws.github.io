The problem is that no one quite seems able to agree on what that something is. Ask 10 people who've just seen this movie what they think it's "really" about, and you might get half a dozen different explanations. I know, because I did just that after seeing mother! for the first time at TIFF. Read more... More about Jennifer Lawrence , Darren Aronofsky , Mother , Entertainment , and Movies Tv Shows
