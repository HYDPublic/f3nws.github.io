Sit down, folks. The Anthony Scaramucci drama just got even crazier â€” thanks to a self-proclaimed "email prankster." According to CNN , the prankster posed as former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus from a mail.com account, and reached out to Scaramucci, who resigned Monday from his job as White House communications director. SEE ALSO: Anthony Scaramucci resigned and everyone is hahahahahahahahaha This exchange came the day after Priebus stepped down, according to emails shared with CNN by the prankster: Not Reince Priebus : "I had promised myself I would leave my hands mud free, but after reading your tweet today which stated how; 'soon we will learn who in the media who has class, and who hasn't', has pushed me to this. That tweet was breathtakingly hypocritical, even for you. At no stage have you acted in a way that's even remotely classy, yet you believe that's the standard by which everyone should behave towards you? General Kelly will do a fine job. I'll even admit he will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don't expect a reply." Read more...
