It's World Naked Gardening Day, the only day of the year when exposing your private bits while hoeing around the garden is celebrated internationally. Launched back in 2005, the unofficial event happens every first Saturday of May and encourages gardeners around the world to get out in the fields, bare ass exposed to the sun, to get dirty in the name of growing things in the earth.
