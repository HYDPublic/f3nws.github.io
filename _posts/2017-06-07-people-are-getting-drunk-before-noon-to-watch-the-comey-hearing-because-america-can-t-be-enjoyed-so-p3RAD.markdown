Nothing says "good morning" in Trump's America better than gathering at a bar with a bunch of strangers before 10 a.m. to drink Russian vodka and watch a Senate hearing ... apparently. On this upcoming, beautiful Thursday, people all over America will wake up, get dressed in their end-of-week finest, and attend one of the many bar parties being thrown across the country for the sole purpose of watching former FBI Director James Comey testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee about his interactions with President Trump. How utterly glorious that this is reality, right? SEE ALSO: Note to Comey: Avoiding a hug from Trump takes practice. Just ask Hillary Clinton Read more...
