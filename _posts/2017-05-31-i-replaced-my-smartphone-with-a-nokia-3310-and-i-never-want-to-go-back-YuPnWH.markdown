![I replaced my smartphone with a Nokia 3310, and I never want to go back](http://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3pkvOY9eUJJeSv2u2rkRduwbRT0=/1200x630/2017%2F05%2F31%2Faa%2Ffc2257348e0041dcbea59346e9c20b19.c184b.jpg)

For the last week or so, my Android smartphone was benchedâ€”I put it into a drawer, and for the next week, barely touched it. Instead, I used the new Nokia 3310 , a reboot of Nokia's 17 year-old phone of the same name, which was once legendary for its longevity and near-indestructibility. I thought I'd suffer the week at the hands of a dumbphoneâ€”that I'd miss my emails, my apps, all of it. The week came and went. Not only was it not that bad, but I'm tempted to never go back to my Android phone. In fact, I'm tempted not to go back to any sort of smartphone, ever again.
