Equifax's latest update on its unprecedented security breach notifies the public that its investigation has found the cause of the theft. Along with an unnamed security firm ( ZDNet and others have reported it's Mandiant) the company confirmed rumors that attackers exploited a flaw in the Apache Struts Web Framework. That bug, CVE-2017-5638 , was revealed in March, but the criminals were still able to use it against Equifax to steal personally identifiable information (PII - including names, birth dates, social security numbers and more) for 143 million people in the US in mid-May .

The site was taken offline after Krebs notified Equifax, but the existence of such an easily-accessed security hole is troubling. According to Reuters , over 40 US states have joined a probe against the company, and its CEO is expected to testify before a House of Representatives panel on October 3rd.

We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation, and have shared indicat...
