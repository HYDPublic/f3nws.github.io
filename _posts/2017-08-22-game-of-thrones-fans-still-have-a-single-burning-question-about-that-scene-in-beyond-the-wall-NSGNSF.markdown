Warning: This post contains spoilers for Game of Thrones Season 7, episode 6, titled "Beyond the Wall." SEE ALSO: Did you catch Daenerys' 'Terminator' moment in 'Game of Thrones'?

Or even the army of the dead dragging Viserion's body out of the water and the Night King resurrecting him as a zombie Ice Dragon.
