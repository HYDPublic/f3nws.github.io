Few people are capable of telling Donald Trump no â€” except, maybe, Melania Trump. Take a look at this latest clip, featuring President Trump walking down an airport tarmac in Israel with his wife Melania. Trump repeatedly goes for his wife's hand, only to have her smack him away. SEE ALSO: Can you find the hidden and scared government official? The clip gets really good/profoundly depressing about 4 seconds in. It's hard to have any empathy for Melania, who recently delivered a women's empowerment speech to Saudi women in which she encouraged them to manage their "work life" balance Saudi women are some of the most oppressed women in the world, and can't travel or go to the doctor without a male guardian's permission.
