As Amazon prepares to lock down its mega-merger with Whole Foods, one of its most controversial sales practices may be coming back to haunt it. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating claims that the online shopping giant misleads customers with the price comparisons it lists on its products, Reuters first reported.

SEE ALSO: Yes, Amazon is convenient, but is it just too damn powerful? The group behind the complaint, Consumer Watchdog, reviewed around 1,000 Amazon products and found these reference prices used on nearly half.
