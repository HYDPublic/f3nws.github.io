Service dogs deserve recognition for the great deeds they perform daily. To them, they aren't even great deeds. They are just ... deeds. Andrew "AJ" Schalk, a 16-year-old junior at Stafford High School in Virginia, certainly wanted to give his service dog, Alpha, the respect that was deserved for someone who has saved his life several times. So he asked his school if they'd be willing to give his dog a spot in the yearbook, and the result is adorable. That's a GOOD dog if I've ever seen one.
