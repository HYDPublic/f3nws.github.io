On Saturday, Twitter user @minnysconsin tweeted a photo of himself with House Speaker Paul Ryan at a Kiwanis Club fundraiser in Wisconsin. It seems, though, that Ryan did not notice (or just ignored) this man's T-shirt, which reads "Repeal and go f*ck yourself." (It's from the Pod Save America podcast merch page, BTW.) SEE ALSO: I am Donald Trump's history tutor and everything is going great The end result? A solid troll reminiscent of that Kellyanne Conway video we all know and love.
