You might know Lenovo for its laptops and Yogabooks , but the electronics maker is apparently used to conjuring up some pretty far-out concepts much more exciting than a 2-in-1. At its third annual Tech World innovation summit, it has revealed not just a couple of new Yogabook colors, but also the concept products it's most proud of, including an augmented reality headset and a smart speaker-projector.

Lenovo says it sees cooking up concepts as an important part of its R&D process, because it lets the company explore and push boundaries.
