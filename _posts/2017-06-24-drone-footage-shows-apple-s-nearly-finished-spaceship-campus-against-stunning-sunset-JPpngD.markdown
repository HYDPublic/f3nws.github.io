Apple's massive new spaceship campus, officially called " Apple Park ," is nearly complete and should officially open later this year. New drone footage reveals how glorious the main campus and the Steve Jobs Theater look just as the sun is setting. The new 2.8 million-square-foot headquarters will be home to over 12,000 Apple employees. It's Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive's most ambitious "product" to date, huge glass panels, toilets inspired by iPhones , patented pizza boxes that prevent pizza from getting soggy, and over 9,000 trees in the quad. Just outside of the campus is the Steve Jobs Theater. The mini flying saucer-like auditorium will play stage to all future Apple product unveilings. It features 20-foot-tall glass panes (the world's largest glass panels) and has room to seat 1,000 people. Read more... More about Tech , Apple , Drones , Steve Jobs , and Apple Park
