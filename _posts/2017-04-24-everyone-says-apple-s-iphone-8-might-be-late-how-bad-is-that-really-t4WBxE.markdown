This is getting serious: While Apple-related rumors are never to be fully trusted, we now have nearly every credible source and leaker chirping in unison that Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 might be one or even two months late. The latest to join the fray is noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who was slightly more explicit than others. According to 9to5Mac , he said the iPhone 8 launch would likely be pushed to October or November. SEE ALSO: The next iPhone might have a new name... and it's kind of lame The delay, Kuo claims, is due to production difficulties for several custom components Apple has ordered. There's no word on which components, exactly, are the culprit, but previous reports indicated that Apple (just like Samsung) is having trouble making the under-the-glass fingerprint sensor to work reliably. The iPhone 8 is also rumored to have a (possibly curved) OLED display and 3D-sensing front cameras, which are new technologies for Apple's iPhone and could also cause production delays Read more...
