Macadamia is as cute as a button, or a tiny nut, perhaps more accurately. The koala joey is the first of 12 babies at Australia Zoo this year, weighing only half a gram and being the size of a jelly bean when he was born. SEE ALSO: These people are way too happy to be this close to a great white shark Named by the Australian Macadamia Society, he's spent seven months growing in his mother's pouch and has only recently begun to explore the outside world. Joeys will spend up to 12 months with their mothers before going independent. In the meantime, go on and enjoy this very cute mother and son duo. Read more...
