Over the weekend, Trump tweeted out a gif (that his staff found on Reddit) depicting an archive clip of him wrestling with WWE CEO Vince McMahon, whose face was overlaid with the CNN logo. The stunt quickly drew condemnation from both sides of the aisle and also instigated CNN to track down the person who initially posted the gif that Trump lifted without attribution, one HanAssholeSolo (or HAS).

In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same. CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change. This statement instigated a backlash from conservative media, with Donald Trump Jr leading ...
