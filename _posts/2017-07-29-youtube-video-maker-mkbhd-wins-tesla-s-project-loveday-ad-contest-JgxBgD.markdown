Tonight at 11:45 PM ET Elon Musk will deliver the first production Tesla Model 3s during a livestreamed event , and now the company has some new ads to play during any down time. Fans of its cars and technology submitted their own advertisements for the Project Loveday contest , which was inspired by a 10-year-old's letter. Musk announced the three winners tonight on his Twitter account , with YouTuber and tech reviewer Marques Brownlee aka MKBHD nabbing the top spot. The winner has been promised a trip to a Tesla product launch, and Tesla said it will play the most popular videos on the stream tonight. The winning isn't just a slick look at the car, it also shows off some of the high tech features like Summon and its appropriately-named Ludicrous Mode acceleration. Tesla has eschewed traditional advertising for its vehicles so far, but now that it has so many high quality videos to pull from -- and a car with a price closer to the mainstream -- maybe that could change.
