We'd just like to remind everyone that's it's completely acceptable to buy something from the children or teen section, even if you're a full-grown adult. No one will ever know or care. Harry Potter fandom continues to show no sign of stopping, and the franchise is now basically considered a timeless classic that people of all ages will enjoy for generations. So, it's not too surprising that Pottery Barn Teen is launching a classy new home collection inspired by the books by J.K. Rowling, which wrapped up 10 years ago.
