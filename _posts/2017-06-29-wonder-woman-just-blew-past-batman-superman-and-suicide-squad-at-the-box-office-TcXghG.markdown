Did you hear that distant drumming? That was Wonder Woman pounding the entire DC Comics cinematic universe at the box office — and in about a third of the time.

Wonder Woman became WB/DC's top grosser in just four weeks of release, beating out the entire 14-week run of Suicide Squad earlier this week, then zooming past Batman v Superman just before the weekend.
