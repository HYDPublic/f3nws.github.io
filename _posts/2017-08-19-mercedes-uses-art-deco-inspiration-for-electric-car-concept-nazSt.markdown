Luxury vehicles from the 1930s were nearly aircraft carrier-long. It was the art deco era dominated by seemingly never ending clean lines.

There is one area that's a throwback to the past and that's the cluster in front of the driver. The gauges are based on wind turbines a common design element used in Art Deco.
