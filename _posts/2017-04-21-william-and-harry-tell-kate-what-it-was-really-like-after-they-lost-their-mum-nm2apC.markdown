The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry have spoken candidly about the impact of Princess Diana's death on the their mental health in a new film as part of their Heads Together campaign to end mental health stigma In the film above — streamed on Facebook Live on the Royal Family's account — the three royals talk about the various pressures they've experienced in life, and the importance of speaking openly about mental health. Prince Harry says he thinks people who've experienced loss at a young age should talk about it sooner, rather than bottling it up. "We've never really talked about losing a mum at such a young age," he says to William. "When you speak to other people's families, you think, wow I don't want them to have to go through the same thing." William says that over the years he and his brother haven't talked enough about their mother. WHile Harry adds that thinking in that way can be really damaging. "I always thought to myself, what's the point in bringing up something that's only gonna make you sad? It ain't gonna change it. It ain't gonna bring her back," he says Kate says she thinks it's "incredible" how strong the two princes are, and how they've been able to cope. Read more...
