The truth is still out there, and so is The X-Files. Fox has renewed the beloved sci-fi franchise for another season, following the ratings success of last year's revival. Season 11 will once again be executive-produced by creator Chris Carter, with stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson returning in their roles as FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The upcoming season will feature 10 episodes â€” up from the six episode order the show received for Season 10. The event series is set to air during the 2017-2018 season, with production to begin this summer.
