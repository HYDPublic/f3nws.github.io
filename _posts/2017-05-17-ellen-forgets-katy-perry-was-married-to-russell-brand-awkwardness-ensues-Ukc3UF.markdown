Katy Perry may be single at the moment, but do you remember her two-year marriage to Russell Brand back in 2010? Ellen clearly doesn't. SEE ALSO: Ellen has the best reaction to 5-year-old's unexpected Trump burn Perry appeared on her show on Tuesday to promote her new album, and the two played a game called "Will You Perry Me?" (basically Perry was shown a sequence of male celebrities side-by-side, and she had to pick which she preferred in each round). Before the game started, though, there was a mildly awkward bit of conversation about marriage: Oops. Luckily Ellen is awesome and managed to style the whole thing out, but in the wrong hands that could have been a total cringe-fest. Read more...
