![Take an early look at the Galaxy Note 8 in 'Midnight Black'](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F30ca149905d7aca4162110f2feaa1e5%2F205527081%2Fdims%2B%25281%2529.jpeg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=2e668c316dd9ff66cc7bcd81089843fc7d9350f7)

While the Galaxy Note 8 won't launch until August 23rd, noted leaker Evan Blass aka EVLeaks has just poste d a full render of the device in its Midnight Black color. Closely matching renders seen before , it takes the Infinity Design seen in Samsung's well-received Galaxy S8 and S8+ and stretches it across a larger frame. The event invite promised we'd "Do Bigger Things," but other than the usual Note features like a stylus it's hard to say exactly what will be special about this phone -- other than a slightly smaller battery to avoid last year's explosive issues .

This is our clearest look yet at the smartphone and its dual-cameras, again, set to arrive on August 23rd. It also shows a rear fingerprint sensor in roughly the same spot as on the Galaxy S8 -- a place that makes it tough to access and easy to smudge your camera's lens.
