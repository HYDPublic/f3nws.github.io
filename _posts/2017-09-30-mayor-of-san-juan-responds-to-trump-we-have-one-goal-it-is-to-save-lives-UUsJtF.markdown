After President Trump tore into Mayor Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz on Twitter on Saturday morning, the mayor took to TV to briefly defend herself and advocate for the rest of the island. "This is what we have, it is one goal: it is to save lives," the mayor told MSNBC's Joy Reid. "I have no time for distractions. All I have is time for people to move forward and get help." Cruz's comments were part of a larger effort by the mayor to attract additional military and emergency resources to the devastated island.
