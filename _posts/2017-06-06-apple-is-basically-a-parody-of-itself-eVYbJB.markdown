If you were trying to construct a parody of every Apple product presentation of the last 5 years, you probably couldn't have done much better than the keynote the company offered at WWDC on Monday. CEO Tim Cook barely present on stage? Check. Interminable updates on stuff almost no one uses, like Safari, Mail, Maps and the Apple Watch? Check. A parade of presenters we've never seen before? Check. Groan-worthy dad jokes from Craig Federighi? Check (this year the Apple VP outdid himself with 420-related humor based on Apple's new MacOS name, High Sierra).
