Stephen Colbert's oral sex-themed joke about Trump and Putin prompted alt-righters and conservatives to call for his dismissal , arguing that it was homophobic. But guess what? He's not even bothered. On Wednesday's show, the late night host acknowledged the furore he caused on Monday when he said Trump's mouth was only good for being Vladimir Putin's "c**k holster." "Welcome to The Late Show . I'm your host, Stephen Colbert. Still? I am still the host? I'm still the host!" he said, according to a transcript provided to CNN . "Now, if you saw my monologue Monday, you know that I was a little upset at Donald Trump for insulting a friend of mine." Read more...
