Pete Souza is back at it again with the Instagram shade, and this time he's coming for Sarah Palin and her famous band of sidekicks. Sarah Palin, Ted Nugent, and Kid Rock ( author's note : ⁉️ ⁉️ ⁉️) hung out with President Trump on Thursday. And afterward, the former Alaskan governor shared photos of her visit on Facebook, thanking Trump for the invite. But one picture in particular caught Souza's eye.
