Ten US sailors were missing and five injured Monday after their destroyer collided with a tanker east of Singapore, in the second accident involving an American warship in two months. The guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with the merchant vessel Alnic MC near the Straits of Malacca in the early hours, the US Navy said. "Initial reports indicate John S. McCain sustained damage to her port side aft," it said in a statement as the ship headed to port in Singapore.
