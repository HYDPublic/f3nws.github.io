Dating a comedian can come with some challenges. What may seem like a heartfelt gesture may eventually lead to a troll for all to see. Comedian Mike Recine texted his girlfriend earlier this week, telling her that he had written her a poem. It was a little cheesy, sure, but heartfelt nonetheless. Turns out the poem was actually just the lyrics to the theme song from the sitcom King of Queens.
