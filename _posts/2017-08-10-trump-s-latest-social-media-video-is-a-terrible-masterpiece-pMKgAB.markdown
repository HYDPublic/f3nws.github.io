It seems every week the White House social team tries out different video transitions ... and it always looks terrible. Here's a brief look at this week's masterpiece, which is 3-plus minutes of photos and videos sliding from the top, bottom, and sides of the screen, accompanied by Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the USA." It ends with a Looney Tunes effect on a waving American flag. Watch the whole thing, if you dare. These video skills are out of control, as people noticed on Twitter. Trump just wanted to show off how good he's getting at Windows Movie Maker. Look at those transitions, pretty sharp. â€” Tea Party Amercan (@BarryWirth) August 9, 2017 Read more...
