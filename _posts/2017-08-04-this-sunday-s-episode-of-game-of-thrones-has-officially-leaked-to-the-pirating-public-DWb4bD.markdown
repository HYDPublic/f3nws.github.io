Well, if you wanna make HBO mad, you can now watch Sunday's Game of Thrones episode a few days early.

The episode, Season 7, episode four, entitled "The Spoils of War," appeared on the subreddit r/freefolk , a popular Game of Thrones discussion board that is not moderated. Reddit user zmax87 posted it early Friday morning and said in the comments that it was a "Gift from Pakistan."
