One canvas, two kilometres (1.2 miles) long, 300 million years old. The first Aboriginal light festival of its kind in the world, Parrtjima , is back for another year. It's an annual, free, ten-night festival celebrating Arrernte (Central Australian) art and culture, held in Mparntwe (Alice Springs, Australia) from Sept. 22 to Oct. 1. Numerous large-scale light works are being switched on every night, including a highly ambitious illumination of the epic MacDonnell Ranges.
