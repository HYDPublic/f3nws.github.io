A few mountain bikers had an unwelcome guest briefly joint their downhill run at the Malinô Brdo in Slovakia recently. YouTuber Dusan Vinžík was following his friend down the mountain when a huge brown bear jumps in front of Vinžík and starts to charge his buddy. Vinžík screams to alert his friend of the bear that's following him and the bear cuts off trail. The biker in front stops, which was probably a good idea considering the trail ahead had a switchback, which would have put the bikers right in the path of the bear after it cut off trail. It's unclear what made the bear end its chase, but it was likely a combination of multiple bikers and Vinžík's yelling that scared the bear back into the woods. Read more...
