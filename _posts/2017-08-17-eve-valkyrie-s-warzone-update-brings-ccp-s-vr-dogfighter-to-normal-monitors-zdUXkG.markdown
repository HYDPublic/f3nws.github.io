We’ve seen quite a few virtual reality projects that are just ported from normal screens to fancy goggles— Half-Life 2 was a notable early adopter, with Superhot , ARK , Tabletop Simulator , Elite Dangerous , and more taking the same route. But a game starting in VR and then heading to normal screens? That’s a weird one. That’s what CCP is doing with EVE Valkyrie though. Nearly a year and a half after Valkyrie ’s dogfighting debuted on the Rift and Vive, a forthcoming update is set to bring it to your non-VR displays . Rebranded as EVE Valkyrie - Warzone , the update is due to arrive on September 26 (alongside a price drop to $30), at which point you’ll be able to fight both in and out of VR—though I can’t tell from the announcement whether there will be cross-play between headset and monitor users. It seems like it would be unfair, given how much easier it is to look around the cockpit in VR. To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here
