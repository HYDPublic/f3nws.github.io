Disney's first trailer for A Wrinkle in Time is here, and it looks, in a word, magical. Ava DuVernay ( Selma ) directed the adaptation of Madeleine L'Engle's science fantasy classic. And she's brought out some big names to help her out. SEE ALSO: Lin Manuel-Miranda shows off his Cockney accent for 'Mary Poppins' at D23 Like Oprah, Mindy Kaling, and Reese Witherspoon, who play a trio of celestial beings. And Chris Pine and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, as a married scientist couple. Michael Peña, Zach Galifianakis, and André Holland are also on board. But really, the star of this show is 14-year-old Storm Reid, a relative newcomer who plays Meg Murry. When Meg's dad (Pine) disappears, she sets out to bring him back, with her younger brother (Deric McCabe) and her friend (Levi Miller) in tow. What follows is a singular adventure through the cosmos, thanks to a wrinkle in the fabric of space and time. Read more... More about Movies , A Wrinkle In Time , D23 , D23 Expo , and Entertainment
