Lucky number 13. SpaceX just performed its 13th rocket landing back on Earth after launching 10 communications satellites on their way to orbit on Sunday at 4:25 p.m. ET from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. The Falcon 9 rocket booster — equipped with brand new titanium fins for landing — touched down on a drone ship in the Pacific, making it the eighth such successful ship landing in the company's history, with the other 5 landings occurring back on a pad on solid ground in Florida.

SpaceX also brought back a Falcon 9 booster to a drone ship in the Atlantic on Friday afternoon. Read more... More about Space , Nasa , Science , Elon Musk , and Rockets
