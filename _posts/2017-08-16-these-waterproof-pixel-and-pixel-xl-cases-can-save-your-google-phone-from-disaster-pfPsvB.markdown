Thanks to all the Pixel 2 leaks we saw last week, we can now safely say that there’s pretty much no reason to upgrade your current Pixel or Pixel XL if you were planning on buying the smaller of Google’s two new Pixels. It looks exactly like last year’s Pixel models, but it’ll have the specs bump we were all expecting. Of course, anyone currently using a Pixel or Pixel XL knows that it’s more than powerful enough to get the job done.

Lucky for you, the Lifeproof FRĒ SERIES Waterproof Case for Google Pixel and Lifeproof FRĒ SERIES Waterproof Case for Google Pixel XL add waterproofing to your Google phone without the bulk normally associated with waterproof phone cases.
