![Reports of bad iPhone 8 sales have been greatly exaggerated, analyst claims](https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JuclJbyI4RJQR_qm2KNTwjSdiXo=/1200x630/2017%2F09%2F27%2Fba%2F9934ea526aa74249bc6b5583056da8d5.ca7f2.jpg)

Are Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus selling poorly? It depends how you look at it. According to often-accurate Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, via MacRumors , iPhone 8 and 8 Plus sales are less than stellar simply because a lot of potential buyers are holding out for the iPhone X. SEE ALSO: Report claims iPhone X production hasn't even started yet Kuo is essentially agreeing with other assessments that iPhone 8 and 8 Plus sales are weak compared to earlier models, but he thinks the market is "excessively negative" about the whole thing. According to Kuo, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus sales have been roughly half of the sales of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, or even 6S and 6S Plus. But that's alright, because Apple is counting on half of its sales coming from the iPhone X â€” and that device won't become available until Nov. 3. Read more...
