Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the greatest films ever made. So what's the point of adding a 3D veneer to bring it back to theaters? Not much, it turns out. In exchange for a slight touch of artificial depth, I found the remaster darker and occasionally blurrier than normal. But really, this isn't anything new. I had a similar experience a few years ago with the re-release of Jurassic Park -- another classic film that was brought back to theaters just for the novelty of seeing it in 3D. As I sat in the mostly empty Alamo Drafthouse theater this week, I couldn't help but wonder: When will Hollywood realize these 3D re-releases are a huge waste of time? I'm not against bringing back older films in theaters, especially when they've been cleaned up with a spiffy digital restoration. It's a great way to let audiences experience classics on the big screen -- the way they were meant to be seen. But the 3D experience typically adds little to those movies. Since they weren't shot with 3D in mind, the additional depth is usually subtle. And in cases where it's more pronounced, it tends to feel forced. These remasters are also stuck with the usual caveats for 3D presentation (more on that below). Ultimately, retrofitting older films with 3D simply feels like a naked grab for higher ticket prices. I won't say 3D is entirely useless in theaters. Films like Avatar , Hugo and Gravity have used the technology to deliver truly unique and immersive experiences that wouldn't be possible with 2D alone. But most 3D films aren't worth the effort of slipping on a pair of glasses. And you pay dearly in terms of quality too. The 3D shades block out light, just like sunglasses, which leads to a duller and less vibrant image. Many theaters also don't run their projectors at the proper brightness (I'm looking at you, UA Court Street), which makes things even darker. All in all, with 3D you often end up paying more for something that looks significantly worse than a standard 2D screening. And there are other issues with 3D as well. If you wear glasses, you have to balance another...
