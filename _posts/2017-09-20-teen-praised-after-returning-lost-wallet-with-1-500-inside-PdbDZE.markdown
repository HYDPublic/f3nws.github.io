A teen is receiving praise on the internet after returning a wallet he found with $1,500 cash inside. Melissa Vang posted a short clip to Facebook on Friday showing a young man waving a wallet at the security camera pointed at her front porch. After a few moments, the teen leaves the wallet on the home's welcome mat, and slowly takes off. "My husband dropped his wallet (with hundreds of dollars and all his credit cards) in our drive way and this gentleman picked it up and left it at our doorstep," Vang wrote on Facebook. The woman later tracked the young man down, and says she thanked him and rewarded him with $150 for his actions. Read more...
