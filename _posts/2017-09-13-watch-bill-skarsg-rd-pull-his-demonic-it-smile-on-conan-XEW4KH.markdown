Bill Skarsgård is an undeniably delightful-looking human — until he smiles like a homicidal clown. The 27-year-old Swedish actor stars as neighbourhood killer clown Pennywise in the new adaptation of Stephen King's novel It . He showed off his killer smile on Conan on Tuesday, without the makeup. SEE ALSO: Alexander Skarsgård trolled his brother at the 'It' premiere and the photos are downright perfect "You have easily the most evil, demonic smile I think I've seen in all of horror — and I've worked with Andy Richter for a long time." says O'Brien. Skarsgård apparently learned the technique from his brother Gustaf when he was just ten years old. Yeah, not cute. Read more... More about Movies , Smile , Conan O Brien , It , and Bill Skarsgard
