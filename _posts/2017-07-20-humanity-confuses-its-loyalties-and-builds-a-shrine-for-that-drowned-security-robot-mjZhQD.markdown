Hey, fellow humans, I thought we were all on the same page here? When news broke that a security robot mall-copping its way through the Washington Harbour gave up and drowned itself , we all rightly celebrated the admittedly small victory for mankind. Because, ya know, if drones are going to take our jobs they should at least be miserably toiling their mechanical lives away. So why am I now finding out that you went and built this thing a shrine ? To make matters worse, you named the bot Steve? Steve ?! This is the memorial for Steve the drowned security robot outside our office on his charging pad.
