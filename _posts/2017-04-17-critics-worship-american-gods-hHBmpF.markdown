Starz officially enters the book-to-TV-fantasy arena with American Gods , based on Neil Gaiman's 2001 novel, on April 30. Starring Ricky Whittle and Ian McShane, the story subverts religious mythology in a twisted, modern world. Critics viewed the first few episodes and, so far, praise is high for the show, which should please the book's rabid fan base.
