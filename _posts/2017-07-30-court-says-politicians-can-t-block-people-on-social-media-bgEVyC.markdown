Indeed, the senior staff attorney of Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute (aka the plaintiff in the lawsuit against President Trump) told The Wall Street Journal : "We hope the courts look to this opinion as a road map in holding that it is unconstitutional for President Trump to block his c...
