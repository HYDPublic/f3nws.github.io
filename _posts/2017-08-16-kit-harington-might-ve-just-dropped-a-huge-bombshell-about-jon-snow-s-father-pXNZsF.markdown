With only two episodes left in Game of Thrones season 7, we’re getting closer and closer to that battle against the undead that Jon Snow is so afraid of. That’s not a spoiler. After all, that’s what we’ve been waiting for ever since season 6 concluded. But if you still haven’t seen episode 5 you should avoid what’s about to follow at all costs, because there are spoilers ahead. Kit Harington, who plays Jon Snow, talked to The New York Times about his character. While he did not tell us what happens next, he did offer what appears to be a huge Jon Snow clue. The Times asked the actor about the major revelation that came at the end of season 6 — that Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark are his parents. “Mmmm … Well ...

One’s named Viserion because it’s after her brother Viserys, and the other is called Rhaegal because it’s after her brother Rhaegar,” Harington explains. “I never really liked Viserys, so I guess it’ll have to be Rhaegal for me!” I may be reading too much into this particular reply, but it sure sounds to me like Harington is implying that Rhaegar was indeed Jon Snow’s father. It’s definitely one way to interpret his answer given what we know about Jon Snow right now. And it’ll certainly be interesting to see whether Sa...
