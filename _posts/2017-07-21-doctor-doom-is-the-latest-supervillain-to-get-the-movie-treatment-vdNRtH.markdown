Fantastic Four villain Doctor Doom is the latest Marvel bad guy to get his own movie. During the panel for his FX mutant series Legion, showrunner Noah Hawley revealed that he's currently developing a movie centered around comic book baddie Victor Von Doom, the archenemy of the Fantastic Four , for 20th Century Fox. Fox currently holds the movie rights to Marvel's mutant characters, including the X-Men and Deadpool, along with the Fantastic Four and their supporting cast. The villain was played by Julian McMahon in Fox's 2005 Fantastic Four flick, and its 2007 sequel. Toby Kebbell filled those shoes in the 2015 reboot of the franchise, which flopped at the box office and tanked any prospect of an ongoing film series starring those versions of the characters (played by Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Miles Teller). There's no word on whether Marvel's fab foursome will appear in Hawley's Doctor Doom as a way to reintroduce the quartet. Read more...
