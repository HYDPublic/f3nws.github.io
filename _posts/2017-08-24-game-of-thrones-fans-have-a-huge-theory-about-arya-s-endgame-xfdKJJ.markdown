Warning: Contains stealthy spoilers for Game of Thrones Season 7, episode 6. Arya had so much potential for Season 7. Literally five minutes into the season she'd managed to wipe out the entire Frey family, and it looked like she was all set to start crossing the big hitters off her list nice and early. Flash forward to episode 6, though, and it still hasn't happened. Now it looks like she's more likely to come to blows with her own sister than dispatch Cersei.
