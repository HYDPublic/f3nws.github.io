Computers may no longer be tech darlings now that everyone uses their smartphones to do basically everything, but they're about to get really exciting again. About every two years, Intel introduces new processors that shape the computing industry and this year's no different. Whereas the last two generations of chips were kinda like half steps in performance, the new 8th-generation "Ice Lake" Core processors are nearly twice as fast as 7th-gen "Skylake" chips . It's a big bump up in performance and you'll feel the speed even if you're just browsing the web. SEE ALSO: The Best Instant Cameras The first computers (laptops and 2-in-1s) with 8th-gen chips, available in Core i5 or i7 (U-series) flavors, will ship at the beginning of September with up to 145 designs available. Desktop processors will ship in the fall and then enterprise versions later. Read more... More about Intel , Computers , Chips , Pcs , and Silicon
