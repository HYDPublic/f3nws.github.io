Congrats, you just made $178,041! Well, that is, if you're Floyd Mayweather, standing in the ring against Conor McGregor on Saturday night â€” and you took one second to read that sentence. SEE ALSO: Floyd Mayweather totally out-classed Conor McGregor, but oh what a show! In what has to be the biggest single payout in sports history, the 40-year-old Mayweather stands to make a total of $300 million for his win over 29-year-old MMA superstar McGregor. (He'd have made the same win or lose, so the fact that he won by KO to preserve his perfect 50-0 record is just gravy.) Saturday night's fight carried a $100 million guaranteed purse for Mayweather, but he also gets a sizeable chunk of the pay-per-view from Showtime. Estimates range from $150 million to $200 million for that part, so we're giving the benefit of the doubt (and his own personal estimate) here. Read more...
