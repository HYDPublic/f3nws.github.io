(Reuters) - A 24-year-old man was shot and killed in Baltimore on Saturday, police said, breaking a 72-hour "ceasefire" called by activists who had pleaded for a pause in the city's record homicide rate. Community leaders organized around the social media hashtag Baltimore Ceasefire issued a general plea that "no one kills anyone" during the 72 hours of Friday, Saturday and Sunday. By the end of July, Baltimore police reported a record 204 homicides, according to the Baltimore Sun, leading to the Baltimore Ceasefire movement.
