J.K. Rowling had some choice words to share with her followers in the wake of Saturday's cowardly terrorist attack on London citizens. She was tweeting in response to a New York Times post that characterized the United Kingdom as "reeling" in the wake of its second terror attack in two weeks. Saturday's incident followed a May 22 suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. SEE ALSO: J.K.
