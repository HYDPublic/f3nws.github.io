Apple may still view the Apple TV as nothing more than a hobby, but the company is certainly doing all it can to transform its venerable set-top box into a must-have device. Though previous incarnations of the Apple TV left much to be desired, the forthcoming Apple TV 4K seeks to address at least a few of the complaints users had. From a slightly improved remote to the long-overdue addition of 4K support, it'll be interesting to see if Apple's latest effort will resonate with consumers once it hits store shelves tomorrow. With the embargo on Apple TV reviews lifted, a number of publications earlier today published their first impressions of the device.

While I was mostly positive on the last model, its lack of 4K became a sticking point when I upgraded to one of LG's 4K OLED TVs last year. I ended up relying more on my set's built-in apps to enjoy 4K/HDR content, and I only hopped over to the Apple TV when I needed to use iTunes (my preferred platform for digital purchases) or specific streaming apps.
