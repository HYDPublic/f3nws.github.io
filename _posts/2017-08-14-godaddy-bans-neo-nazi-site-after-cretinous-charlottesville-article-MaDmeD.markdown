The US neo-Nazi site the Daily Stormer has 24 hours to find another internet provider after it published a disparaging article about woman who was killed during protests in Charlottesville. SEE ALSO: Charlottesville really happened. Don't look away. 32 year old Heather Heyer died after a car ran into a crowd of peaceful protesters, demonstrating against a white supremacist rally. Some Twitter users, including women's rights campaigner Amy Siskind, called on the web hosting company GoDaddy, which houses the Daily Stormer , to remove the site. GoDaddy replied on Twitter saying the neo-Nazi site had violated its terms of service: "We informed the Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service."
