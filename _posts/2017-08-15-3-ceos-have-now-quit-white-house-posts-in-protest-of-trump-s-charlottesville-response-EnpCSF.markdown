Three CEOs have resigned from Donald Trump's manufacturing advisory council to register their disapproval of the president's weak initial response to last weekend's violent white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville. Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank and Intel CEO Brian Krzacnich both announced their decisions in separate statements Monday night, following in the footsteps of Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier that morning. Several other corporate leaders have joined Frazier in speaking out about the hate and bigotry of last weekend's violent white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville.
