A couple have been awarded compensation of $3.25m (Â£2.53m) after their adopted baby son was murdered by his birth father, weeks after he regained custody of the child. Rachel and Heidi McFarland sued their lawyer Jason Rieper for malpractice after he wrongly led them to believe three-month-old Gabriel's biological parents had signed release-of-custody papers. The couple had arranged to adopt the child from Rachel's teenage co-worker Markeya Atkins and were present at his birth in Des Moines, Iowa, in December 2013.
