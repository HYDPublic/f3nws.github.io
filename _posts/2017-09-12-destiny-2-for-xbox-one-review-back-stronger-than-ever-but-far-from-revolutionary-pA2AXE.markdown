Destiny 2 improves upon the original in almost every way, although strays away from becoming legend. Despite mixed opinions on the game at launch, it can't be argued that the Destiny has become one of the biggest names in the industry today. Maintaining a healthy player base three years after launch, Bungie's online shooter has been the latest success story for the developer â€” building a name close to overshadowing its own Halo series. Four expansions, hundreds of hours, and an endless onslaught of loot later, the game's successor, Destiny 2, has finally hit store shelves. Delivering a much-improved Story mode, a slew of enhancements to gameplay and a much deeper ecosystem, the game is already shaping up to be one of the biggest launches in 2017. And while Destiny 2 may live up to its promises, many of these stray from being a true evolution. See at Amazon See at Xbox Store...
