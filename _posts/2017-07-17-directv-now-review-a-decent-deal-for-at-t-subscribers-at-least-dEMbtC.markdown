Editor's note: This review was updated in its entirety on July 16, 2017 to reflect our current experience with DirecTV Now after AT&T fixed a number of the service's shortcomings. The past seven months haven’t been stellar for DirecTV Now. AT&T’s streaming bundle crash-landed last November with a load of glitches and missing features, earning it poor reviews and a reportedly stagnant subscriber base . AT&T has made DirecTV Now more reliable since then, and it launched a Roku app alongside the existing Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, iOS, Android, and web versions. And while DirecTV Now has nixed its original promo rate of $35 per month for 100 channels, it’s sweetened the deal for AT&T wireless subscribers with streaming TV plans starting at just $10 per month when bundled with an unlimited data plan.
