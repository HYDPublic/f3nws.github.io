Netflix turned David Ayer loose on his elves-and-orcs fantasy cop drama Bright, a movie that "is taking itself seriously," leans hard into issues of race, and will put plenty of gnarly, hard R-rated violent action on our home screens this December.

It's Netflix's most ambitious original movie since its first, Beast of No Nation , in 2015.
