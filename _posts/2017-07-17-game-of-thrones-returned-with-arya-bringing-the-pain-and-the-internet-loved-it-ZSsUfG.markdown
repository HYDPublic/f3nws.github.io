Season 7 of Game of Thrones wasted no time in dropping the mouths of all the rabid fans who waited too long for the show to return. And Arya Stark made those mouths drop. In the opening scene of "Dragonstone," we all watched Walder Frey and scratched our heads. "I thought Arya killed him like a complete and totally ninja assassin last year," we told our cats. But then, ( SPOILERS ) Arya removed her old man mask as the poisoned men fall around her. And the internet remembered why it loves Game of Thrones. That just happened, Arya single handedly killed an entire family #GameOfTrones pic.twitter.com/N8xv6xjUjQ â€” K I C K S (@Kicksrarted) July 17, 2017 Read more...
