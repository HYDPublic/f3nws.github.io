This post contains spoilers for the Season 2 premiere of This Is Us , titled "A Father's Advice." The Season 2 premiere of This Is Us finally revealed how Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia) died, but of course, there was a twist. In a case of be careful what you wish for, the new episode, titled "A Father's Advice," showed us the manner of Jack's death — a house fire that decimated the Pearson family home — but not the when or why. Instead, we see distraught, teenage versions of Kate and Randall sobbing on the couch at Miguel's house, while Kevin is conspicuously absent — he's out somewhere with Sophie, sporting a broken leg, completely oblivious to the trauma unraveling in his family. Elsewhere, we see Rebecca driving alone with what seems to be a bag of Jack's personal effects in the backseat, before she pulls up outside their incinerated house and breaks down in agonized tears.
