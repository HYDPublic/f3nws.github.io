Stone Island likes to bring technology to its fashion lines, like the strangely compelling AirPod pockets sown into its Fall/Winter collection we saw last month . Now the fashion concern has a new sweater that changes color depending on the temperature. The garment is called Ice Knit , with an outer layer made of thermo-sensitive yarn and an inner layer of pure wool to keep you warm (and maybe keep your body from messing with the color change). The sweaters, available in yellow-to-orange, emerald-to-military-green and ivory-to-anthracite, are only available via Stone Island's mobile app between September 11th and September 13th. They've got an interesting heat-map look, for sure (especially the yellow and orange sweater), which could make for some enthralling conversations if you wear one out into the colder weather this fall.
