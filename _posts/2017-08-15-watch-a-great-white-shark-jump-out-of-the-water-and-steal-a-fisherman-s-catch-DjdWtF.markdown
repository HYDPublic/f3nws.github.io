Great white sharks ripped away the catches of two fishing expeditions in Cape Cod Bay this weekend The crazy part of the story? Both incidents involved the same captain and happened on the same day â€” and he caught them on video On the first trip, a woman was reeling in a large bass when a shark bit it straight in half, leaving only the fish's head attached to the line. Later in the afternoon, Captain Hap Farrell was out fishing with another group when a different shark struck. This time, it decided to put on a bit of a show.
