Unless you're a seasoned NASA engineer with knowledge of planetary protection protocols and the guidelines that astronauts and scientists much adhere to in order to prevent humanity from contaminating worlds (including our own), there's very little chance you have a shot at landing NASA's new Planetary Protection Officer position. That is, unless you're nine-year-old Jack Davis, who wrote to the agency with the hopes of scoring the job, and definitely did not get a denial.

Clearly surprised that the best applicant so far happens to be a nine year old boy from New Jersey, NASA's James L. Green, Director of the Planetary Sciences Division, wrote back to Davis to encourage his love of science and space. While the reply didn't include a formal job offer, it also wasn't exactly a denial. The only logical explanation is that NASA is simply working out the logistics of hiring a fourth grader, but I'm confident they'll figure it out before Davis' parents waste any money on back-to-school supplies — NASA probably doesn't make you bring your...
