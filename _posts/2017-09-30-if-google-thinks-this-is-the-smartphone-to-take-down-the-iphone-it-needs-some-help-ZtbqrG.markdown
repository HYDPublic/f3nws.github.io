The Pixel 2 phones are not quite here yet, but we already know almost everything there is to know about the new Google handsets. They’re going to have similar specs, including some unexpected surprises, and offer a bunch of novel features, which is only to be expected of any new smartphone. But the phones aren’t exactly equals when it comes to design, as it was the case with the original Pixels. HTC is making the Pixel 2, while LG is in charge of the Pixel 2 XL.

Given that the Pixel 2 looks like last year’s Pixel, it sounds as if I’m saying now the iPhone design that Apple used for the last three years is incredibly ugly. It is, but only because we have an iPhone X to look at. The Galaxy S8 doesn't look bad either: Let's check out the Mi Mix 2 from Xiaomi: What about LG's V30, which will compete directly against the Pixel 2 XL? Compared to the Pixel 2, even the Essential Phone lo...
