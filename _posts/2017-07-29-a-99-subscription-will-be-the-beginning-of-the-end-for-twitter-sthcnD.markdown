You know that guy on Twitter . He (or she) is always firing off what they're up to (no matter how mundane), commenting on every trending hashtag, and often tossing out flashes of #dailyinsight. This is the Twitter Influencer™, and it's a species as old as Twitter itself. Even if you don't value what this kind of person has to say, chances are you follow a couple of them—maybe because you once met them in real life and thought they seemed okay, or you clicked on a few of them when you were new to Twitter. Or maybe you were simply curious what the hell a professional influencer does all day. SEE ALSO: Ed Sheeran doesn't need Twitter, but Twitter needs him Read more...
