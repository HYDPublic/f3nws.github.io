Spoilers follow for Game of Thrones Season 7, episode four. So don't act like you haven't been warned, dummy. Finally, (most of) the Starks are back together. With winter falling all around Winterfell, it was only fitting that the Starks have a family reunion for most everyone who's still alive. This episode saw the triumphant return of Arya. Though two dullards tried to keep her out of her own home, there's no stopping a girl who is no one and it led to a very emotional reunion with Sansa over their father's grave. Things were only made more weepy when Bran joined them by the weirwood (even though he's v creepy now and wtf is he). Read more...
