How to improve a video of a breakdancing Gorilla in a paddling pool? Easy, just add "Maniac" from the Flashdance soundtrack. You don't believe me? Just watch this: People were mesmerised by the talented animal letting his freak flag fly: hahaha magical https://t.co/esBAAPm5wb — Joel Pavelski (@joelcifer) June 22, 2017 Gorilla dancing to “Maniac” is essential viewing https://t.co/5ErP1vnZKg — Spencer Steel (@spencerjsteel) June 23, 2017 I have watched this so many times, I really wish the gorilla could hear 'Maniac' while dancing, so joyful, and kinda made me dizzy.... — Leanne Davies (@Davis1Davies) June 23, 2017 Read more...
