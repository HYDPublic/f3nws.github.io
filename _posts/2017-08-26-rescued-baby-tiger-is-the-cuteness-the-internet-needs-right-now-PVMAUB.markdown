A baby tiger that was smuggled into the United States from Mexico by a teenager is now safe and doing well at the San Diego Zoo. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers seized a small male Bengal tiger cub early Wednesday morning when 18-year-old Luis Eudoro Valencia attempted to smuggle the animal into the country in his car. The teen says he bought the tiger for $300 on the streets of Tijuana from a man who was walking an adult tiger on a leash. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service took over the cub from customs, and it was then passed off to the zoo. In a post on its website, the zoo says the cub is in good health . Veterinarian Dr. Jim Oosterhuis estimates the cub to be about 5 to 6 weeks old, weighing in at just over 6 pounds. Read more... More about Rescue , Zoo , San Diego Zoo , Tiger Cub , and Culture
