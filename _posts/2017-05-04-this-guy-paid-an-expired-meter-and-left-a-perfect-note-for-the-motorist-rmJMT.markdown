Who doesn't love a good insurance salesman story? Finding new business to sell insurance to does not sound extremely exciting, but one agent figured out a pretty slick way to entice potential clients. A photo of a note that was left on a car with an expired meter hit the front page of Reddit on Wednesday . "I paid your parking meter for you ... imagine what else I'm willing to do to protect your car," the note reads. Attached to the note is the business card for Andrew Cooney, a car insurance salesman based out of Rochester, Minnesota.
