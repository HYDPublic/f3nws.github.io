Kanye West has been one of Tidal's biggest champions: he joined the company the moment Jay-Z relaunched its service , and The Life of Pablo was one of the streaming music service's largest ( if temporary ) exclusives. However, it appears that the relationship has... soured. TMZ sources claim that Kanye has left the company over a payment squabble involving both Life of Pablo and music videos.

That's good news for would-be listeners if the scoop is accurate, but it it also undermines both Tidal and its alliance with Sprint . If they can't get Tidal's superstar owner to hold to an exclusive for more than a week, what will they get fro...
