Spoilers for the season finale of Game of Thrones Game of Thrones is a show that knows its way around an incest plotline, so people shouldn't have been too surprised when, in the final moments of the Season 7 finale, Jon and Daenerys finally pushed through a season of awkward, charged moments and had sex on a boat while Tyrion hung out in the hallway. SEE ALSO: Should Dany and Jon hook up on 'Game of Thrones' or nah? Anyway, because the show was kind enough to take the extra step of confirming for fans that, yup, these two are definitely related right before the big moment happened, people were ... conflicted about the proceedings.
