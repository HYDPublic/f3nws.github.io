A light plane made an emergency landing on a packed beach near Lisbon on Wednesday, killing a man and an 8-year-old girl who were sunbathing. The plane made little noise as it skimmed low over hundreds of people on Sao Joao da Caparica's sands, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) south of Lisbon, witnesses told Portuguese media. "It happened very fast, there was no chance to prepare... to run," Enrique Coelho, who was playing with his son at the beach and saw the plane crash, told cable news station SIC Noticias. Some sunbathers ran into the sea to avoid the plane, witnesses said.

"Those first moments were very tense," one witness, named only as Mafalda, told a Portuguese paper "People wanted to attack the pilot and began to shout and call him a 'killer'. Everyone was really disgusted.” Police intervened and led the two occupants of the plane away.
