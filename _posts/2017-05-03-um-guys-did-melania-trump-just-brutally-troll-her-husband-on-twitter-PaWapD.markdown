Sometimes, a subtle 'like' is all it takes to expertly troll someone. And sometimes, an accidental 'like' can send someone into a regret spiral so deep, they may never claw out. It's unknown if either hypothetical scenario relates to the potential sh*tstorm just kicked off by Melania Trump on Twitter, but DAMN. Long story short, she just 'liked' a very shadey tweet (on her personal account, not the @FLOTUS one) about her husband/POTUS. SEE ALSO: Melania Trump says Donald doesn't get â€˜enough credit' At least, it seems that way. Witness: The shadey tweet in question.
