Sony has been hinting at a big version 5.0 firmware update for the PlayStation 4, but... what does it entail, exactly? Eurogamer has an idea. The site has obtained release notes that hint at at least a few tangible upgrades. To start, PS4 Pro owners will have the option to broadcast their gaming on Twitch at a brisk 60 frames per second. That's nothing new for the PC crowd, of course, but it's a big deal if you want to showcase a fighting game or shooter at the same frame rate you see on your TV. There's more whether or not you have a Pro. Families now have the option of multiple adult accounts, and you can set parental controls on a per-account basis (teens can have more freedom than their younger siblings, for instance). You can also follow anyone's account, not just well-known developers and video personalities. And if you're tired of having to go back to the home screen to see your system notifications, they'll be available in the Quick Menu. It's still not certain when 5.0 will show up, but Sony started taking sign-ups for beta testing in mid-July. There could still be weeks to go before there's a publicly available version. When it does arrive, though, it could launch alongside a revamped PlayStation mobile app with an upgraded design. Source: Eurogamer
