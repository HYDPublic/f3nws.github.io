The VAUX Cordless Home Speaker + Portable Battery for Amazon Echo Dot is easily one of our favorite accessories ever for Amazon’s popular Alexa speaker. Simply drop your Dot in the top, connect it, and it’s instantly transformed into a portable smart speaker. The Echo Dot is great, but it’s even better when you don’t have to keep it plugged into the wall. As an added bonus, it also includes its own speakers with great sound quality that might even be better than the $180 Echo! Here are some key details from the product page: * Enjoy up to 6 hours of portable run time with our rechargeable lithium ion battery. * Dual 52mm Drivers and a passive radiator for impressive sound and bass * Compatible with Amazon Dot Echo (2nd Generation) * Use Amazon Dot's Power Supply and Cable to Charge Vaux. * 3.5mm Aux Input for use with external mobile players
