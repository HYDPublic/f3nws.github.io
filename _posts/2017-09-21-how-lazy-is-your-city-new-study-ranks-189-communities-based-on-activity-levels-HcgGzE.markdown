Did you take a spirited run this morning? How about a brief yoga session or a brisk walk? If you spent the day laying on the couch, binging Netflix and eating puffy Cheetos, that's fine too, but you're definitely not helping your city's exercising ranking. A multi-year poll with over 350,000 participants has resulted in the ultimate ranking of the most active metro areas in the country, as well as the laziest. The poll, which was conducted by Gallup and Sharecare , paints a rather interesting picture of the United States that might not match up with your preconceived notions of where the healthiest people actually live. For example, would you imagine Colorado has three of the top four most active communities in the US? Or that Anchorage, Alaska, beats out the likes of San Francisco, Austin, and Miami? Feast your eyes on the full list, and see just exactly where your home lands in the rankings: 1. Boulder, CO 69.6 percent 2. Fort Collins, CO 67.9 percent 3. San Luis Obispo–Paso Robles–Arroyo Grande, CA 67.0 percent 4. Greeley, CO 65.3 percent 5. Santa Rosa, CA 62.3 percent 6. Urban Honolulu, HI 61.4 percent 7. Hilton Head Island–Bluffton–Beaufort, SC 61.4 percent 8. Anchorage, AK 61.3 percent 9. Clarksville, TN–KY 61.0 percent 10. Chico, CA 60.9 percent 11. Santa Maria–Santa Barbara, CA 60.7 percent 12.
