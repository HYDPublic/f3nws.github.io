The blast, at the start of the holy month of Ramadan, was one of the deadliest seen in Kabul, killing 80 people and wounding another 463, Deputy Interior Minister Murad Ali said.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said some embassy staff had been injured and at least one local security guard was killed.
