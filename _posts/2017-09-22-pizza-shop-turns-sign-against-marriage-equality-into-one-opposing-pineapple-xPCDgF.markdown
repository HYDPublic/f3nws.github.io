While the debate rages on over marriage equality in Australia, one pizza shop has had a nifty response to an advertisement against it. Wiseguise Pizza in Launceston, Tasmania found an "It's OK to say no" billboard attached to their store. It's part of a campaign to get Australians to vote against the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the country. SEE ALSO: Fireball, the unofficial beverage of regret, is now available in bagel form So the shop's employees decided to do something about it, and get it to say no to something else: Pineapple on pizza.
