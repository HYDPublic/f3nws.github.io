A massive fire described as the biggest in the history of Los Angeles was raging Saturday, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate their homes. The blaze has so far destroyed one house and forced the evacuation of nearly 500 homes in various parts of the city and neighboring Glendale. More than 500 firefighters were mobilized, while 100 others who had been deployed in Houston, Texas to help rescue operations after Hurricane Harvey were asked to return.
