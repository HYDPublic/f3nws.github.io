The Magic School Bus took some very important field trips this Earth Day, making stops at Marches for Science across the world. As science lovers joined together at more than 500 events on Saturday to get their voices heard, everyone's favorite eccentric, fictional science teacher, Ms. Frizzle, became a prominent symbol in the resistance. Dozens of science fans dressed up like The Friz and repped The Magic School Bus signs, proving even our most magical childhood dreams can come true if we're willing to "Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy!"
