First Justin Bieber, now Beyoncé. Beyoncé joined forces with Reggaeton powerhouses J Balvin and Willy WIlliam for a remix of their popular hipshaker "Mi Gente" to raise money for Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Carribean nations ravaged recently by natural disasters. "I am donating my proceeds from this song to hurricane relief charities for Puerto Rico, Mexico and the other affected Caribbean islands," she wrote on Instagram. "Mi Gente" has been a formidable hit of its own, running for awhile now on the Billboard Hot 100. The remix is reminiscent of Justin Bieber's collaboration with Louis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee on "Despacito." The original song swept Latin America, but after Bieber lent his voice, it skyrocketed to the most-streamed song of all time. Read more...
