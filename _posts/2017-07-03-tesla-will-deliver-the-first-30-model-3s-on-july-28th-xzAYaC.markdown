Tesla will start delivering its much-anticipated Model 3 EV this month, as promised . CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company will have a "handover party for [the] first 30 customer Model 3s on the 28th." He added that production will grow exponentially, "so August should be 100 cars and September above 1,500." By December, the company will be building 20,000 cars per month, he said in a subsequent tweet. The goal is to produce up to 10,000 cars per week by 2018.

If Tesla meets its production goals, the Model 3 could become one of the top twenty best-selling vehicles in the US in 2018, ahead of stalwarts like the Hyundai Elantra and Nissan Sentra. The first customers to get the Model 3 will be owners of current Model S and Model X vehicles, and after that, it'll depend on your place in the pre-order queue. Elon Musk said in May that Tesla will open 100 new "retail, delivery and service locations" to keep up with repairs and service. The Model 3 won't have the "ludicrous" 2-second 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of the Model S, but it will scoot to that speed in 5.6 seconds. That gives it bragging rights over Chevy's Bo...
