Google Assistant is already a great help in the kitchen when we need to convert something from pints to cups or remember to buy eggs on our next shopping trip. But with a new update to Google Home, it’s graduating to full-on sous chef. In a feature rolling out to users just in time for Mother’s Day, Google Home will now provide step-by-step instructions to more than 5 million recipes from Bon Appétit, the New York Times, Food Network, and more. And you can even listen to music while doing it. The new system isn’t quite as simple as saying, “OK, Google, tell me how to cook coq au vin,” but it’s pretty close.

Once you find something that looks good, you can select the new “Send to Google Home” button, and it will be saved to your recipe box.
