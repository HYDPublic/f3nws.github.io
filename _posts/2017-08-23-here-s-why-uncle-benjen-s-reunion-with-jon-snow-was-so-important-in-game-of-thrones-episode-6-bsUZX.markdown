Jon Snow just won't die on Game of Thrones . And the latest episode, " Beyond the Wall ," provided us with the most convenient plot twist of all to save him. Uncle Benjen's back! Oh dear, now Uncle Benjen isn't back :( But we're not all that sure Ben's final moments in the episode necessarily prove he's dead. Despite being mobbed by wights, there's a lot to suggest otherwise, actually. First, though, let's do a refresher on who the hell Uncle Benjen even is in the first place, why his reunion with Jon was so meaningful, and what the it might mean for his role in the future. Benjen was Ned Stark's youngest brother, who served as the "Stark in Winterfell" while all his brothers were off fighting in Robert's Rebellion. Almost immediately after Ned (his only surviving sibling) returned from the war, Benjen decided to go off and volunteer to join the Night's Watch. Read more...
