The theme of the 2017 hurricane season: Dire, destructive, and deadly storms bordering on hyperbolically intense, continues with Hurricane Maria. This time, the storm is taking aim at the U.S. Virgin Islands, particularly St. Croix, as well as Puerto Rico. It's difficult to overstate the danger that Hurricane Maria poses to Puerto Rico, an American territory that is home to 3.4 million. This storm is unlike any other that the island has experienced since the 1920s or 1930s. The storm is likely to act like a buzzsaw wherever its tightly wrapped eyewall touches. This part of the storm, which encircles the calm eye, contains the strongest winds, which may gust above 200 miles per hour. This wind will mow down trees and strip them of vegetation, drive branches and street signs into power lines, and tear apart homes and businesses roof first. Read more...
