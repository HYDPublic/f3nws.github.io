Ray "Stallion83" Cox is an Xbox achievement hunter, playing hundreds of games to earn as many achievements as possible to rack up his gamerscore. His drive has kept him in first place for Xbox gamerscore for over 11 years â€” until Tuesday. Unfortunately, Cox decided to get married and go on a honeymoon. Instead of playing games to keep his gamerscore rising, he was apparently too busy enjoying his new marriage, giving runner-up Stephen "Smrnov" Rowe enough time to dethrone the gamerscore king and take the record out from under Cox's nose, TrueAchievements reported.
