Atlus has been infamously protective of Persona 5 even before it came out, and it looks like that hasn't changed a bit. The game developer has submitted a DMCA takedown notice against the creators of the PS3 emulator RPCS3 and their Patreon crowdfunding page . Emulators typically fall within the legal gray area of copyright law -- they don't infringe on anybody's intellectual property, but they can run illegal ROMs that do. However, as Kotaku noted, RPCS3's Patreon included updates about how far they are on getting Persona 5 to run on the emulator.

According to the emulator maker's report on Reddit , that seems to have resolved the situation. Atlus has confirmed that it issued a DMCA takedown notice in an announcement, where it explained its reasons for doing so. The company said it didn't want people's first experience with an Atlus game to come riddled with framerate drops, crashes and other issues. It explained that the company thinks a format it didn't personally oversee won't deliver the experience and quality it intended. The gamemaker admits that it's aware of how a lot of fans would like to see Persona titles for the PC, and while it's not making any promises, it says it's listening to people's wishes. Those who'd like to see PC ports of Atlus' most beloved games might want to cross their fingers and hope for the best. Here's Atlus' statement in full: "You might have heard earlier today that we issued a DMCA takedown notice involving emulation developer group RPCS3 and their Patreon page. Yes, it's true. We settled upon this action for two reasons: 1. We believe that our fans best experience our titles (like Persona 5) on t...
