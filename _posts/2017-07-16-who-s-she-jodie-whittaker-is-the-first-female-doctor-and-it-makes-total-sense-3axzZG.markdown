The BBC has made it official: Jodie Whittaker will be the 13th actor to play the lead role in 'Doctor Who' full-time. She'll take over the TARDIS from Peter Capaldi this December, when everyone's favorite Time Lord from Gallifrey finally undergoes his much-delayed regeneration. Whittaker, the first woman to play the Doctor in the show's 54-year history, has already spent three seasons working with incoming showrunner Chris Chibnall (plus former Doctor David Tennant) on Chibnall's moody murder-mystery show Broadchurch . And that's not the only reason she's perfect for the role. SEE ALSO: If you ever loved 'Doctor Who,' now is the time to watch Read more...
