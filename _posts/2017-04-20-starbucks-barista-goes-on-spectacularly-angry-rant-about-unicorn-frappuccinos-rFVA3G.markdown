The world is well and truly obsessed with unicorns. So much so that Starbucks has just launched a Unicorn Frappuccino to bring unicorn-flavoured drinks to the masses. But one Starbucks employee isn't happy about it. SEE ALSO: Starbucks has launched a Unicorn Frappuccino to grace the Earth On Wednesday's launch of the new drink, a Starbucks barista took to Twitter to launch a tirade about the frappuccino and urge the world to never, ever order it. "I need to rant just a little bit," says Braden Burson just before raising his voice. "Well, today [the Unicorn Frappuccino] came out and I have to tell you: PLEASE DON'T GET IT!" "I have never made so many frappuccinos in my entire life! My hands are completely sticky! I have unicorn crap all in my hair, on my nose," he yelled. "I have never been so stressed out in my entire life!" "If you love us as baristas, don't order it," Burson pleaded. Starbucks describes the limited edition drink as "flavour-changing" and "colour-changing" with "magical flavours" which start off sweet and fruity and transform to "pleasantly sour." "Swirl it to reveal a colour-changing spectacle of purple and pink. It's finished with whipped cream-sprinkled pink and blue fairy powders," reads a description of the drink on Starbucks' website.
