St. Louis-based hairstylist Caitlin Ford, or caitlinfordhair on Instagram, has upped the ante on the unicorn hair trend. "My client wanted something fun she could show off while she was out celebrating St. Louis Pride Fest this weekend," Ford told Allure . So she came up with the perfect idea and dyed her client's armpit hair into a delightful, colorful rainbow. Ford aptly calls her latest trend Rainbow Pits.
