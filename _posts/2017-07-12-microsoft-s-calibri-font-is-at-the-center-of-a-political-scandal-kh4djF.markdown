Pakistan's government is in trouble. And its fate may hinge on a Microsoft font. Judicial investigators probing the financial assets of the country's Prime Minister and his family allege his daughter (and apparent successor) forged documents to hide her ownership of overseas properties. How did they reach that conclusion? The documents from 2006 submitted by Maryam Nawaz (daughter of PM Nawaz Sharif) were in the Calibri font.

"Why would anyone use a completely unknown font for an official document in 2006?" he questioned. Meanwhile, the Wikipedia page for Calibri has received so many edit requests that it's now on lockdown. But someone did manage to squeeze in a reference to the corruption probe, so that's part of the font's online history now. Sharif, who is currently on his third-term having been ousted twice in the past, found himself under investig...
