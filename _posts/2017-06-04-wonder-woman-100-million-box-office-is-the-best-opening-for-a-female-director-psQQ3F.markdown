Patty Jenkins is a star. Wonder Woman banked an estimated $100.5 million in domestic ticket sales, making it the largest-ever opening for a film directed by a woman â€” that's Jenkins. It's also the most critically acclaimed DC Extended Universe to date by a wide margin, with a "fresh" rating that almost exceeds the combined "rotten" ratings of its three predecessors. SEE ALSO: 'Wonder Woman' is the most inspiring superhero movie in years Sunday totals are still just an estimate of course, but there is virtually zero chance of Jenkins falling short of the record. The previous #1 was Sam Taylor-Johnson, the director of Fifty Shades of Grey , which opened with $85.2 million at the U.S. box office in 2015. Read more...
