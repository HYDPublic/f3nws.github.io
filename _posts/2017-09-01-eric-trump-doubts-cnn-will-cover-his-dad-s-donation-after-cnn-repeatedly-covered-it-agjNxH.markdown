Eric Trump doesn't trust the lamestream media to cover his dad's truly terrific, just wonderful deeds. Like his plan to donate $1 million to help Harvey victims. You won't see that on CNN anytime soon. SEE ALSO: Life is tough on Twitter when you share a name with someone in Trump's administration So proud!!! Let's see if @CNN or the #MSM acknowledges this incredible generosity. My guess: they won't.. https://t.co/hTQd2qnsR2 — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) August 31, 2017 Let's see what the #MSM was covering instead of giving Poppa Trump his credit ... You guessed wrong. We covered the pledge online and on-air well before your tweet. 🤦‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/j9QgnxXgve — CNN Communications (@CNNPR) September 1, 2017 Read more...
