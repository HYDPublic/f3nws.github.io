If you've read Ivanka Trump's book Women Who Work (which you probably haven't, but we have ) you'll notice the heavy amount of quotes (at least 50 per cent) from other famous people. British primatologist Dr. Jane Goodall, 83, happens to be one of the lucky many. "What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make," her quote reads. But Goodall is not too pleased about the acknowledgement, considering her support for action on climate change and environmental conservation. Via the Jane Goodall Institute, she released a statement to Mashable . SEE ALSO: We read Ivanka Trump's insufferable new book so you don't have to Read more...
