It's here, people: earlier in the week we had some sweet, delicious hints that the Foo Fighters would be starring in a surprise episode of Carpool Karaoke , and we have not been disappointed. The 13-minute adventure starts out with some vigorous air-drumming to "All My Life," carries on with even more vigorous air-drumming during "Best Of You,"then warms down with some slightly less vigorous air-drumming for "Learn to Fly." SEE ALSO: Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams are too adorable on 'Carpool Karaoke' Also there's some discussion of how the Foo Fighters formed, a chat about the infamous stadium leg break show, and a visit to one very lucky guitar shop.
