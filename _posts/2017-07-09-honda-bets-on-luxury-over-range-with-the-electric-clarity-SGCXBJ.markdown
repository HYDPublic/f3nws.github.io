In 1998 Honda introduced the first hybrid to North American roads. The Insight looked like a futuristic CRX and should have heralded the automaker as a leader in the green-car space along with Toyota and its Prius. Except it didn't. The Prius took off while Honda continued to produce the less-popular Insight along with a few other hybrids including a V6 Accord. The company even tip-toed into the electric market with a limited run of Fit EVs. But as for a proper electric platform, it wasn't until this year that the automaker decided to enter the market with the Clarity. Clarity is Honda's new line of green cars. Previously, the Clarity was just a fuel-cell vehicle with limited availability. Now it's three automobiles on a single platform: a fuel-cell version, plug-in hybrid and the pure electric car we drove. Honda says the entire line is about making a choice based on your driving habits. So before you throw down some cash, you have to decide, "How far will I really drive in this thing?" For folks interested in the EV, it's not that far. The electric Honda Clarity has a range of 89 miles -- far fewer than a Chevy Bolt, Tesla Model 3, and Volkswagen e-Golf. But what it lacks in range it makes up for in luxury -- according to the Honda. To be fair, the company mostly delivers on that argument. The interior feels more like an Acura than a Honda with plush seats, recycled Ultrasuede door accents, wood paneling and stitched materials. From the back seats to the dash, the car feels far fancier than other Hondas. Our videographer, Kyle, was especially smitten with the comfort of the rear seats. (We don't let him sit in the front. He knows why.) The front seats were equally cozy except for one thing: legroom. At 6-foot-3, I found the driver's side legroom to be wanting. I felt cramped and wondered if Honda's desire to make passengers in the back seat feel welcome was at the expense of the actual driver. At least if they're tall. The rest of the of the interior was less anti-tall-person. The dash is neatly laid out and includes the requisite touchscreen in the cente...
