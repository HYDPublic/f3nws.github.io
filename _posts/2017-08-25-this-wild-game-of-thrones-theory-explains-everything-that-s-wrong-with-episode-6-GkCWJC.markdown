The fast-paced season 7 of Game of Thrones is almost done, and we’ve had a wild ride so far. Other than the time-and-teleportation issue , and some logistical problems with the action in episode 6, the current season was just brilliant. But we have a brand new fan-theory out there that seems to be entirely plausible. And it explains everything that’s wrong with episode 6. Before you move past the break, remember that what follows is dark and full of spoilers . In short, Bran is the Night King.

If you ask me, that theory makes sense. I do think that the Night King knew the dragons were coming. Things come full circle for Bran and the entire series. That’s why Bran, trapped into the Night King’s body, will wait thousands of years to attack the humans. That’s why he doesn’t kill Jon Snow or any other living person in episode 6. That’s why he goes after the dragon in the sky and not the one on the ground, and that’s why his horde has the chains. The full...
