Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau knows how to throw the internet into a frenzy. Whether it's making everyone swoon by wearing a cool firefighter jacket , showing up to a meeting wearing Star Wars socks , or challenging Matthew Perry to a fight , he knows what the people want and gives it to them. Now, Trudeau is taking over prom season. The Canadian prime minister surprised a group of prom goers when he jogged passed their group photos for the big night.
