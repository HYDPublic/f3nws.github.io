So, unless you're wise enough to have disposed of all social media and moved to a cave upstate, you've probably heard that Twitter is experimenting with a new 280-character tweet limit. Unfortunately, Twitter has only granted the power to a random sample of select users -- at least natively. We already saw a Github script to get around Twitter's restrictions, and now someone has packaged that code into a simple bookmark. All you need is a tiny Javascript widget and about 20 seconds of your time. Juliette Pretot, a web developer, has managed to put together a work-around using TweetDeck and a small piece of Javascript. She outlines the process in her post , but basically, all you have to do is add a bookmark to your bar, go to TweetDeck (a third-party Twitter client), click on the bookmark, and then use TweetDeck to compose and post your tweet. It'll then show up on Twitter just like normal: https://twitter.com/chrisfmills/status/913137439111307266 In case you're having any problems, just note that you need to click the bookmark before you open the compose window, not after. You'll also have to re-click the bookmark every time you reload the webpage. Regardless, it's not a lot of work to get access to the biggest new feature Twitter has released in years. Just make sure you use your 280-character powers for good, not trolling.
