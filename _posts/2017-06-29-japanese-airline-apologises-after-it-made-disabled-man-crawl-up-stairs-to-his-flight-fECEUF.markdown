A Japanese airline has apologised to a disabled passenger, after he was forced to crawl up a flight of stairs to board his plane. Hideto Kijima, a wheelchair user, had to pull himself up the stairs after airline staff refused to allow his friends to carry him aboard.

Kijima, who has travelled to 200 airports across 158 countries, says this is the first time he has not been allowed assistance to board. Read more...
