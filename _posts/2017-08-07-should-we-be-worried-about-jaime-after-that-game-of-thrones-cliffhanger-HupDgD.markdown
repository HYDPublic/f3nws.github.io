To add insult to injury, Cersei is apparently feeling confident (read: arrogant) enough that she's now ignoring Jaime's desire to keep their effed up incestuous relationship on the DL by openly flaunting it in front of the hired help , all while promising Euron that she'll probably marry him someday maybe if he's good just ask again later okay?
