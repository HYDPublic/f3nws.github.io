Elon Musk has been talking and tweeting about the Model 3 for years, but on Friday night the talking ends and the first 100 Tesla Model 3 all-electric cars roll off the assembly line and into customers' (who are also employees) hands. Oh, and the talking doesn’t stop. Musk will mark the occasion with a speech that you can watch via live stream . He may answer many lingering questions about the all-electric, 4-door sedan like: Why only one dashboard screen? And how does this car differ from the Tesla Model S? Is the Model 3 a sequel?
