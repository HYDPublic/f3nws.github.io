You know not to play around with crocodiles. Especially when they can drag an entire cow through the water, as witnessed in a video uploaded onto the Facebook page of Trip In A Van , who said the moment happened during a fishing trip in the Kimberley, Western Australia. "We follow him with the drone as he swims down the river with his lunch," the post reads. "He eventually gets the shits with the drone buzzing around him and tries to pull the cow underwater. An amazing display of how powerful these big creatures are!" The animal was estimated to be about 5 or 6 metres (16 or 17 feet) long, and once again, a creature you definitely don't want to get too close to. Read more...
