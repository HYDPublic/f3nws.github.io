Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz from Utah was supposed to be at home resting from foot surgery related to a 12-year-old injury — instead he scooted into the Capitol with a big smile on his face as he voted to kill Obamacare. SEE ALSO: Give Trumpcare a break: Here's all the pre-existing conditions it will cover The irony, of course, is that the House's rushed health care repeal bill would allow states to get rid of protections for people with pre-existing conditions — much like Chaffetz's own foot injury , the result of falling off a ladder in his garage more than a decade ago. Everyone was quick to notice that the congressman's surgery represents everything he just voted to repeal. And his smile seemed to say , "Good luck with your future health care, suckers!" Or maybe, "Thanks, chumps taxpayers, for footing the bill for my pre-existing condition. Bummer about yours!" Read more... More about Meme , Repeal And Replace , Obamacare , Chaffetz , and Gop
