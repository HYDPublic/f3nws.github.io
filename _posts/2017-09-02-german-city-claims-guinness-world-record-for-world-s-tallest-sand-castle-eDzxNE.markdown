Who says beach towns have the monopoly on sand castles? The landlocked German city of Duisburg just claimed the world record for the world's tallest sandcastle. The city's sand castle, which stands at 55 feet or 16.68 meters, won the prize after a Guinness World Record jury judged the behemoth on Friday. The sand castle used 3,860 tons of sand and took more than three weeks to build. The structure was sculpted by a team of designers from 10 countries, incorporating imagery from around the world.
