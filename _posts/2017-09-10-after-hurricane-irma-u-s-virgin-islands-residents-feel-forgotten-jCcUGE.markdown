The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) are facing a communication crisis as families resort to social media to receive information on loved ones and the state of their homes in the wake of Hurricane Irma. Media accounts of the record-breaking storm have focused largely on Florida, but comparably little attention has been paid the status of people and devastation in the USVI, which felt Irma as a Category 5 hurricane. Information on the territory’s three main islands — St. John, St. Thomas and St. Croix — is available sporadically at a local level.
