The robotic racing series Roborace is still somewhat of a pipe dream that aims to become the " world's first self-driving racing series ." On Friday, we got our first in-person look at the 200-mph vehicle that will eventually race itself around the track: the Robocar. The sleek, brightly colored racer was plopped down in New York City's Times Square, attracting the attention of NYC locals and tourists who just didn't know what to make of the thing. Its creators believe those questions will soon be answered, adding to the larger conversation about autonomous driving development. The race car, which doesn't need a human driver, will continue its U.S. debut at Formula E's New York City ePrix event this weekend. When the concept was first introduced back in 2015 , the plan was to hold self-driving races before each Formula E event. While the Roborace cars aren't ready for that just yet, the company will be showing off its autonomous systems in two on track demos this weekend using the company's prototype DevBot cars. The Robocar, for now, is just for show. Read more... More about Roborace , Formula E , Robocar , Tech , and Artificial Intelligence
