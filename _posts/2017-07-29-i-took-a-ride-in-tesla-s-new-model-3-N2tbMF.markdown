After celebrating the delivery of its first 30 Model 3's to eagerly awaiting pre-order customers, Tesla invited attendees at Friday night's event to take a spin in the brand new vehicles. So of course, we took them up on the offer.

For the most part, that analogy rings true. The interior of the Model 3 is well appointed with leather seats, power everything and most of the same electronic gadgets that the Model S offers. Despite being a few inches shorter than the S, the Model 3 does not skimp on the legroom. I stand over six feet tall and didn't feel the least bit cramped in the 3's backseat. The Model 3 does have a smaller battery pack than the S so don't expect to engage Ludicrous mode (which it does not offer yet ) and go blowing Lambos off the line . But while the 3 won't suck the fillings out of your teeth with its speed, the car is by no means a no slouch in the acceleration department. You still have access to every horse the electric drivetrain can muster every time you step on the "gas" pedal. I took a ride in the $35,000 base model which boasts a 220 mile range and 5.6 second 0-60. If you opt for the Long Range edition (a $9,000 battery option), that figure drops to just over 5 seconds and extends its drive time to a whopping 310 miles. That means with the bigger battery, you can theoretically get from San Diego, California to Scottsdale, Arizona in a single charge. Of course, why would you push your luck when the Model 3 is fully compatible with Tesla's network of Supercharger stations. However, unlike the Model S and X, Model 3 owners won't have unlimited to the charger stations and will have to pay a small fee each time they're plugged in. Overall though, this is a pretty sweet whip for $35,000. For that price, you could get a BMW 2 series or a Mercedes CLA, but why deal with the hassle of gas? The Model 3 may ...
