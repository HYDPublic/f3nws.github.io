FX's delightfully trippy X-Men series Legion has cast Wonder Woman star SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui as one of the villains for Season 2, showrunner Noah Hawley announced at San Diego Comic-Con. Taghmaoui will play Amahl Farouk, aka the Shadow King. As viewers learned in Season 1, the Shadow King is embodied by Aubrey Plaza (when he isn't appearing as a creepy, globulous, pale dude with yellow eyes), who possessed Jermaine Clement's Oliver Bird after being expelled from David Haller's (Dan Stevens) subconscious in the finale. In Season 2, Taghmaoui "will join us and add to the trio that is Aubrey and Jermaine," Hawley said, hinting that all three will somehow contribute to the performance of the villainous character in one way or another. In Wonder Woman , Taghmaoui played Sameer, a member of Steve Trevor's team tasked with getting Diana to the Western Front. Read more...
