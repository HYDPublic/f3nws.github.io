If you've ever wondered what the word "oops" would be if it were a dog (you have, right?), look no further. Meet Rocco. On Friday, he got stuck inside a tree at a Kentucky cemetery. SEE ALSO: This very good doggo is also a sophisticated art critic Rocco reportedly lodged himself in the tree after climbing into nearby hole dug by a groundhog, then trying to climb back out via the tree's trunk. Rocco, however, is not a groundhog, so he did not quite make it.

Officials also enlarged the hole in the tree should any other dogs attempt the same stunt. Read more... More about Dogs , Animals , Culture , and Culture
