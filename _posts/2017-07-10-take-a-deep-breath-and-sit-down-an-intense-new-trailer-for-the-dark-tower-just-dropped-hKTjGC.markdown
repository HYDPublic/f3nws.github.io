The Dark Tower film is still a month away, but now we finally have some brand new footage to sink our teeth into as we wait for the movie's release. In the clip above we get a peek into the ongoing confrontation between the mysterious Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) and Roland (Idris Elba), including some serious gunslinging skills from Roland, some new shots of the Tower, and some new shots of Mid-World. It's still not clear exactly how the story will fit into the canon of Stephen King's book series, but we're guessing that's going to stay a secret until the film's 18 August release. The Dark Tower hits theaters Aug. 4. Read more... More about Idris Elba , The Dark Tower , Stephen King , Matthew Mcconaughey , and Trailer
