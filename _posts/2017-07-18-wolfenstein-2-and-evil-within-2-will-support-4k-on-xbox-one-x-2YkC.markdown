You'd be forgiven for thinking that most of the games getting 4K support on Xbox One X will come from either Microsoft itself or Ubisoft , but there will definitely be some high-profile releases in the mix beyond what's been mentioned so far. The official Xbox website has let slip that Bethesda's Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus and The Evil Within 2 are both slated to run in 4K with high dynamic range visuals. It's not certain that this is picture-perfect 4K, since some One X titles use upscaling and other tricks to reach the higher resolution, but you should still notice a difference over 1080p. We'd add that neither improvement is shocking, since they're both major titles. Doom and Fallout 4 are already in line, too. Still, it's good to know that you'll have a healthy selection of 4K(ish) games the moment the One X is available. Via: GameSpot Source: Xbox.com (1) , (2)
