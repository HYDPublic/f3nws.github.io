Don't mess with Maxine Waters' time. On Thursday, Rep. Maxine Waters went head-to-head with treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin during a House Financial Services Committee hearing. Mnuchin attempted to skirt past answering Waters' question with some long-winded compliments, causing Waters to repeatedly interrupt with "reclaiming my time" to try to focus his answer. During committee hearings, reps only have a limited time to ask questions, so Mnuchin was running out the clock and Waters wasn't having it, and effectively threw the book at him. Waters' response was badass and brazen, like the congresswoman herself, and has since inspired an a capella gospel remix from YouTuber Mykal Kilgore. "Our beloved 'Auntie' Maxine Waters laid this sermon down so good that I had to sing about it!" Kilgore wrote. "Whenever anybody tries to distract me or block me (even with praise or platitudes) I'm gonna have to let them know that I'm #ReclaimingMyTime!" Wow! Headed for the Grammys. Praises and thanks! - Rep. Maxine Waters — Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) August 1, 2017 Here's the original exchange between Waters and Mnuchin: Now go read Christine Emba's take in the Washington Post about why "reclaiming my time" is important — and possibly bigger than Maxine Waters.
