Google welcomed Honeywell into the Home family as a partner back in January, but now it's finally including both of the company's connected thermostat families, the Lyric and Total Connected Comfort. Users can control them using either Home's voice controls or through Google Assistant on an Android device. That adds to the thermostats' existing integrations with connected platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Samsung SmartThings and user-customized IFTTT functionality. Source: Honeywell
