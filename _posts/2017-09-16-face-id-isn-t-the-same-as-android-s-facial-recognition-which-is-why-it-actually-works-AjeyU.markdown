I recently told you that I can’t defend the notch because of the user experience. Face ID, that I can defend . Whether you like it or not, Face ID is a step towards the future of computing. But assuming that Apple’s Face ID will deliver an experience just on par with what’s available on the newest Android phones that support facial recognition is a massive error is a mistake many Android fans will make. Apple has been working on iPhones for 13 years, and has launched at least one new model every year for X years — that’s ten in Apple lingo. You don’t have to be an iPhone user to know that Apple will not ship unfinished products or experiences just for the sake of being the first to do it. The iPhone X is not a Galaxy S8 or Note 8 (whose facial recognition tech can be hacked with a picture). Apple has been working on this for at least four years if not more. The company acquired PrimeSense in 2013, the company who licensed the Kinect technology to Microsoft. But it only launched Face ID when it thought it would deliver the same seamless experience as Touch ID. That’s why I think ArsTechnica’s Ron Amadeo is wrong to assume that the Face ID experience is going to “suck,” by likening it to what happens on Android. “Face ID on the iPhone X uses a ‘TrueDepth’ camera setup, which blasts your face with more than 30,000 infrared dots and scans your face in 3D. Apple says this can ‘recognize you in an instant’ and log you into your phone,” he writes. “None of that matters. Face ID is still going to suck.” Yes, all of that matters because nobody else in the industry does it right now. It’s that tech that will make Face ID incredibly fast. That tech not only secures Face ID against photo hacks, but it also makes it really fast. It’s probably what convinced Apple to go Face ID-first and ditch Touch ID in the process. Remember, Touch ID is already incredibly fast. It’s so fast that many complained it unlocks the screen too fast and they can’t even glance at notifications. “This is not the first phone we've tried with a facial recognition feature, and they all have the sa...
