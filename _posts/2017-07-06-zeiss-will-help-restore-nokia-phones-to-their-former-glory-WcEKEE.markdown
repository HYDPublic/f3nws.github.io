Nokia's strong reputation in phone photography stemmed in no small part from its use of Carl Zeiss optics. Whether you had an N95 or a Lumia 1020 , you knew the glass wouldn't let you down. But what's happening now that HMD Global is the one making Nokia-branded phones ? Are they doomed to photographic mediocrity? Apparently, you can relax. HMD has struck a deal that will see Zeiss' imaging tech used in Nokia handsets. It won't just be limited to lens design, either. The two plan to work together on "standard-defining imaging capabilities" ranging from software to screen quality. The two companies aren't revealing specifics or launch dates for the first Zeiss-equipped phones in the HMD era. However, it seems likely that HMD will bet on camera quality as a selling point as it moves to higher-end phones and expands sales to countries like the US . A rumored upcoming model, possibly called the Nokia 9, is believed to pack the dual rear cameras you see on many recent smartphones -- a Nokia brand photographer even posted a video that corroborated the leaks. While that specific device might not use Zeiss tech, HMD could clearly use the help as it steps up competition with camera-centric mobile rivals like Apple and Huawei. This will surely get pulled at some point, so I'll mirror it here [source: https://t.co/37yp63CAeC ] pic.twitter.com/GktpXnt4pS â€” Evan Blass (@evleaks) May 16, 2017 Source: HMD Global
