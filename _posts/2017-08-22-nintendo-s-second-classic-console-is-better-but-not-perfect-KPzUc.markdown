When Nintendo announced that the already impossible to find NES Classic Edition was going out of production , there were two reactions: outrage that the company could introduce such a popular product and fail to meet demand, and curiosity -- why would Nintendo kill off the most popular throwback console ever made? The official line is that it was never intended to be a long-term product, but in the months that followed, you had to wonder if the original retro console was merely discontinued to make way for a sequel: The Super Nintendo Entertainment System Classic Edition . Now, that console is almost ready to hit the market, and Nintendo promises that it will make up for the original's shortcomings. The company expects to ship "significantly more" of the new console than the original. And we hope it does -- because if the short preview we had with the console last week is any indication, it's going to sell just as fast as its predecessor. If you've played Nintendo's original throwback console , you know what to expect out of the SNES Classic Edition. It's a tiny replica of the original Super Nintendo, and it catches all the right nostalgic hooks. The dimensions are perfect, the colors are spot on, and the power and reset buttons not only work, but feel nearly identical to the respective click and springy tactility of the originals. On its own, it's a charming desk toy -- but actually flick the power button on, and magic happens: 21 of the best 16-bit Nintendo games are piped directly to your TV over HDMI. The experience is more or less the same as it is with the SNES Classic's 8-bit predecessor -- offering players a horizontal carousel of each game. In fact, it's almost identical, offering the same interface underneath a Super Nintendo theme. There are some extras in this version, however. Tapping up still lets players choose between CRT Filter, 4:3 and Pixel Perfect visual modes -- but now you can choose various frames to dress up the unused screen space that surrounds your gameplay. You can flank your session of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past wit...
