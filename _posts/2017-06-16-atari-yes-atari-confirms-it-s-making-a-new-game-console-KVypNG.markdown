Your retro gaming icon wants back into the console business. Twenty four years after the company put out its last home console, Atari announced Friday that it will release a new console for an already crowded mass market. In an exclusive interview with GameBeats, Atari CEO Fred Chesnais confirmed that the New York company had big plans in the works. “We’re back in the hardware business,” he said. The move was teased last week, when Atari launched a site for something called the Atari Box. The site featured a video of a wood-paneled something that could only be the Atari Box. At this point, little else is known. Chesnais only seems to have told GameBeats that the Atari Box (Or maybe it's Ataribox?) uses PC technology (which, what console doesn't?). He also said they are still finalizing the design and will show it off some time in the future. There is no word on what kind of games would be provided for it or how development would work.
