If you've been searching for a crossover between a smartphone and a PS Vita , look no further. In China, a company by the name of iReadyGo had been making Android-powered gaming handhelds for years -- you may recall its shameless PS Vita ripoff back in 2011. The manufacturer then went on to release several dedicated gaming smartphones and was eventually acquired by Snail Mobile, a local gaming-centric mobile virtual network operator, in mid-2014. Following the W3D from 2015, the company plans to release a new Android smartphone at the ChinaJoy expo later this month, but I managed to spot one lurking around at MWC Shanghai. This upcoming Snail Mobile i7 is a surprisingly well-specced gaming phone for its 1,899 yuan (about $280) price point, especially with its 6-inch 1080p touchscreen, 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, stereo speakers, dual SIM slots and removable 6,000 mAh battery. Now, the i7 is powered by MediaTek's 10-core, tri-cluster Helio X20 (MT6797) processor, so it's more of a mid-range device. You obviously wouldn't be getting the same level of performance as you would with Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 835 , but it's still a good chipset for this price. It also features a 5-megapixel front camera and a 16-megapixel main camera on the back, though there's no word on what kind of image quality to expect from them. I couldn't confirm whether there's quick charging for the massive 6,000 mAh battery, but at least there's a USB Type-C port on the device. On the gaming side, the i7 comes with a standard set of buttons: a D-pad and a joystick on the left, four action buttons plus another joystick on the right and two shoulder buttons. I got to play a Metal Slug -like game on a pre-production device for a short while and everything felt fine, though I'd obviously need some more hands-on time to make sure that the buttons were durable. A Snail Mobile rep added that the final version will have a more polished finish, which is something to look forward to at the July 30th launch. Unlike most random Chinese smartphones, Snail Mobile is actually planning to bring its i7...
